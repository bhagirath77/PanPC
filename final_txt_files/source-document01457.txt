Sales & Specials Jewelry Resource Supply, located in Fremont Washington, recently acquired Alpha-Supply (of Bremerton, Washington.) This strategic acquisition will allow JRS to offer a much
higher range of products at prices that are extremely industry competitive. Alpha-Supply has been in business since 1947, and is a respected name in the industry. Primarily a mail order

business via catalog, Alpha's website is currently undergoing a major overhaul to improve the useability for our customers. Everybody at both JRS and Alpha are extremely excited to announce
this acquisition, and you - our customers - can expect to benefit from this greatly! Help JRS and Alpha spread the word!
