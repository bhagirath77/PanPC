National Climatic Data Center Climate NOAA is charged with helping society understand, plan for, and respond to climate variability and change. This is achieved through the development and
delivery of climate information services, the implementation of a, and and modeling to understand key climate processes. The is an end-to-end endeavor focused on providing a predictive
understanding of the global climate system so the public can incorporate the information and products into their decisions. global observing system focused research NOAA climate mission
NOAA is a key participating agency in the as well as other significant , national, and . U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) international regional activities NOAACIs climate programs
are focused on three themes: to describe and understand the state of the climate system through integrated observations, monitoring, data stewardship; Climate Observations and Monitoring
@ to understand and predict climate variability and change in timeframes ranging from weeks to a century; and Climate Research and Modeling to improve the ability of society to plan and
respond to climate variability and climate change. Climate Information Services monitors and forecasts short-term climate fluctuations and provides information on the effects climate pattems
can have on the nation. NOAACIs operational climate program NOAA's manages competitive grant programs, leads NOAA climate international, and outreach activities, and coordinates climate
activities across NOAA. Climate Program Office education
