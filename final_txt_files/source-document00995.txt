gave numerous secrets of American defenses to the British forces he commanded. Amold, knowing Griswold's layout and precise position, approached the harbor from such an angle that
Griswold's gun positions could never draw an effective shot on the British fleet. Arnold's troops eventually made landfall, and the fort's garrison fought back. Artillery barrages and fire brought
