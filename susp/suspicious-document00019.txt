riparian countries simply do not have the resources to conflict that the conflict has not yet happened. However, this is not the only reason that the conflict has not occurred.
Governments, over the years, have developed agreements and treaties in place so that the conflict can be controlled. [3] [] Changes the civilizations of Egypt and the Egyptian Nile
claimed it was using water management and agriculture about 5,000 years in the Nile valley. The Egyptians practiced Basin, a form of water management adapted to the natural growth
and the fall of the Nile River. Since around 3000 BC, the Egyptians built banks of earth to form alluvial basins of various sizes that have been adjusted from closed to redirect the flood
in the basin, where it sat until the soil was saturated, the water is was then emptied, and crops planted. : An important approach to collaboration is ground there is the principle of
subsidiarity in the framework of the entire basin. Easily to each development of real work to work Cooperative 4 make the decisions at the level of the minimum required. Strategic
action plan and a strategic action plan are two complementary sub-programs included. To promote shared this vision and work on the ground through the realization of the vision-
Please refer to figure 1. Development of a common vision and commitment and a clear goal to build basin may need to filter in promoting them at a level as a whole, to Central and
local government levels. However, shared vision alone is not available, powered by the action on the ground, and must be nourished certainly- Provides step-by-step instructions on
how to build trust between the banks of the country and meet the needs of the people. The program is linked with the practical training program (ATP) in the framework of the Nile
Basin Initiative (NBI) joint program of vision (SVP). NBRP consists of, and will support the sustainability of the activities and initiatives, and will take the form of individual research and
joint development and joint research projects, and the establishment of research groups of the Nile Basin, and dissemination Research results through knowledge, seminars and

It can not be assumed, however, that the agendas of those who purport to speak on behalf of the voiceless are congruent with the agenda for dumb. It is always better to find ways to
enable the poor to speak for themselves. It is a big challenge to create an environment where the parties can share their perspectives and hear the views of others. It must begin with the
premise that everyone has a part of the picture, and that there is a single truth which all desires of all parties meet. Instead, there are many truths, proponents who need to work
together, to understand each other and make compromises for a future that is inevitably linked. (Transliterated:, but clearly, at least in the initial ;). Sometimes, especially in the upper

opportunities for growth and development for the future, so. The promise of regional harmony and economic development At the heart of this challenge is the imperative to eradicate
poverty. Without action now, the littoral states are faced with many problems such as hunger, poverty, environmental degradation and rapid population growth. This is a clear challenge
for the peoples of the basin and calls vision and leadership. The purpose of this brief document is to provide guidelines for a strategic plan that are required in order to realize the
potential of the Nile for the benefit of all. The time has come to move from planning to action. Second Objectives The objectives are: Year, established on 1998. It is composed of senior

Initiative Strategic contains two main types of projects-those who planned and carried out at the basin level, working with all the neighbors as a "shared vision program" (SVP) and those
who carried out between two or more countries of the layer subsidiary called "controlled action program" (SAP). There are two SAP software with Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
