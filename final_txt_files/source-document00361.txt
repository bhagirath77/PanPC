for ages 6 and up. Missile Command | Size 4.1KB (Add to Playlist) User Rating6.5 | 2005 Atari Interactive, Inc. All rights reserved. OVERVIEW: In Missile Command, players take control of
a battery of anti-ballistic missiles as they protect six cities from wave after wave of missile attacks. This is a game of speed and precision. Using your joystick, you must target and time your
missiles so that the concussion from their explosions destroys enemy warheads as they drop. Think fast, shoot accurately, and don't run out of ammo. Once you run out of defensive missiles,
your cities will lie open to attack.
