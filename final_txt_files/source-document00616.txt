Secret Garden Art Gallery New Orleans June 2008 Gambit Rincon PR "these new paintings seem very much in the tradition of Caribbean abstraction... and convey a sense of the light and
texture of Caribbean or Mediterranean places where exuberant joie de vivre is mingled with blood and rust, the dark sediment of history. The Caribbean casts everything in high relief, and here
there's a sense of structures etched with eroded layers of human drama, of walls that read like palimpsests.
