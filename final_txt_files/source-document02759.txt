Lam Osiris Onnophris who is found perfect before the Gods. I hath said: These are the elements of my Body perfected through suffering, glorified through trial. The scent of the dying
Rose is as the repressed sigh of my Suffering. And the flame-red Fire as the energy of mine undaunted will. And the Cup of Wine is the pouring out of the blood of my heart, sacrificed unto
Regeneration, unto the newer life. And the bread and salt are as the foundations of my body, which I destroy in order that they may be renewed. For I am Osiris Triumphant. Even Osiris
Onnophris the Justified One. I am He who is clothed with the body of flesh yet in whom flames the spirit of the eternal Gods. I am the Lord of Life. I am triumphant over Death, and whosoever
partaketh with me shall with me arise. I am the manifester in Matter of Those whose abode is the Invisible. I am the purified. I stand upon the Universe. I am it's Reconciler with the eternal
Gods. I am the Perfector of Matter, and without me the Universe is not." || | | | | || | |  Esoteric Order of the Golden Dawn 2007. All Rights Reserved.
