The American Revolution This feature tells the story of the American Revolution and the loss of Britain's North American colonies during the eighteenth century. Few events possess as much

majority of the North American colonies created disquiet in Britain and fed the flames of radical agitation. The Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the United

Library holds many items related to the American Revolution, recording American and British responses to the times in which they lived. This gallery makes use of some of them to illustrate the
course of the American Revolution and to investigate some of these issues.
