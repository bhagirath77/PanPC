caffeine, possibly an aspirin-derivative, and a few other ingredients sprinkled in. Make no mistake about ithis is a thermogenic product and only a thermogenic product. These basic ingredients
make up the classic /C/A stack that most people find effective (up to 95% of all fat bumers are based on this model). But the fact is, the E/C/A stack may not work well for everyone. Maybe
youe been on the E/C/A stack for a while now. Maybe you drink a lot of coffee in the morning and soda throughout the day. The human body can easily become desensitized to the ingredients
in this stack after prolonged use, thus reducing its effectiveness. For some athletes, the problem may even transcend thermogenesis. Your problem, for instance, might be releasing stored
bodyfat. Or maybe you have a sluggish thyroid (thyroid hormones directly control your body metabolism). You might be insulin-resistant, a condition which makes it extremely difficult to shed
bodyfat. Impaired neurotransmitter function can also make life difficult, encouraging bingeing. Perhaps your problem is not fat at all, but subcutaneous water weight. After all, you can come in
with low bodyfat levels, but if youe holding subcutaneous water, youe cooked. The point is, athletes need to overcome many obstacles in order to achieve maximum cuts and separations. So if
