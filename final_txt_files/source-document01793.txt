Invite The Machine, Americas top Pink Floyd show, has forged a 20-year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the
years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out large clubs and theaters across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned
music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, and Germany's Rock of Ages. The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for
performing a diverse mix of The Floyd's extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of well known hits as well as obscure gems), The Machine's stellar musicianship,
dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest. In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even
rivaling that of an early 1970s Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980s. The
band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A-to-Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the
alphabet. Additionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, enhancing and expanding the sonic depth of Pink Floyd. Tickets go on sale Monday November
