common during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Shakespeare borrowed for his plays ideas and stories from earlier literary works. He could have taken the story of Hamlet from
several possible sources, including a 1100s Latin history of Denmark compiled by Saxo Grammaticus and a prose work by the French writer Franois de Bell Forest,
entitled16001601Hamlet160216031604Histoires Tragiques. The raw material that Shakespeare dedicating writing Hamlet is the story of a Danish prince whose uncle murders prince's
father, marries his mother and claim the throne. The prince pretends to be feeble-minded to throw his uncle off guard, and then manages to kill his uncle revenge. Shakespeare changed
the emphasis of this story entirely, making his Hamlet a philosophically minded prince who delays taking action because his knowledge of his uncle's crime is so uncertain. Join option does

his father was murdered, and the spirit tells him when he slept in their garden, they poured a villain poison in his ear-the very bad guy who wears his Crown, now. However, his solemn
theory in grief and anger, when he saw the explosion Ophelia's funeral procession, Laertes his attacks provided a glimpse of his true feelings had been for Ophelia. Ophelia dead in the
warm embrace of Laertes into the subtle pattern again, hanging on their brothers and sisters incest. Interestingly, the "Hamlet" has never said that the death of Ophelia, he indirectly
caused by his murder of guilt. In fact, the only time he even close to the Bolognese Seoul's death responsibility, all in one and the last scene with Laertes duel before he apologized, and
accused him of "crazy" the death of Polonius. Understand the physical connection between these two monologues is a mistake, however, to align with the core of work, constantly

words can be used to bend and alter the truth. At this stage, Claudio decided clearly that he can appease the anger of Laertes and Hamlet distribute a bulkhead, knocking the idea of duel

not the console or even to join him in a duel, but because it tells Gertrude, was as hard to appease his wrath in the first place. Claudius doesn't have time to worry about the victims of
