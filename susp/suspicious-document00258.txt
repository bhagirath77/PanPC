American market. Modification of standards for safety and emissions made it too expensive for many producers to compete. Finally, the faithful Land Rover reintroduced in 1974 would be
more than a decade after he retired. The problems were on the horizon as well as parent Rover: unhappy British Leyland Motor Corporation was heading toward financial crisis. These
issues came to a head in 1974, when the company was nationalized by the British Government. Following is an overview of the Organization was conducted. Fortunately Rover has been
awarded for significant investments, including the construction of a large new factory in Solihull. Noise management made to expand production of four-wheel-drive vehicles, but for once
these words are not in place to implement. The beginning of a new direction, after the arrival of the new CEO, Michael (later Sir Michael) Edwards was in 1978. Another survey was
carried out promptly, and interviews were conducted with nearly 500 people, about 200 of them were owners cars and only 10 percent of inmates who are Rovers. According to Graham
Bannock, who participated in this exercise, the question arose - anonymously - what customers thought of the appearance of a sedan with a strong car was more robust which can easily
pass on unpaved roads, national songs, or above the beach and the idea of a "new vehicle that combines comfort." The responses, more than 70 percent expressed approval of the
concepts, and so, armed with these statistics, the task of convincing direction has been made much easier. This was not yet the transition, there was no doubt annoying if the public
would be willing to pay a high price for a Land Rover. First step in the right direction came in 1966 and in 1967, when a six-cylinder was offered by Land Rover for the first time,
followed shortly after a "luxury package", including the well upholstered front seats. These options add refinement and comfort for the basic package, but the engineers knew that Rover
should - and can - go much further. Adhering to the principles of a Land Rover classic frame strong and lightweight, resistant to corrosion of the body, a team of 20 engineers - whom
Spen King - began to give flesh to the bone of the Land Rover "civilized" concept. In the hope that one day these restrictions will be abolished ready rover engineers a new small car

United Kingdom market is not the way forward. While the small SUV has sales in several years, none of them had real off-road ability or capital of a Land Rover. Research shows that
customers of these vehicles often searched for more glamorous vehicles such as range Rover, but in their choice to a handful of existing Japanese brands with less pedigree limited.
