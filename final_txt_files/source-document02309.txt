predictive analysis counter threats posed by the global expansion of nuclear energy and legacy weapons of mass destruction (WMD) materials detect the production, characteristics and
movement of weapons of mass destruction and effect respond more rapidly and effectively to events of mass effect. Our talented scientists and engineers work on identifying and
understanding proliferation and terrorism signatures, systems to collect materials, sensors to quantify and characterize these materials and techniques that assist in analyzing possible terrorism
events. WeCIre making significant contributions to counterterrorism and infrastructure protection, including teaming with organizations to ensure our air and seaports are protected from
terrorist attacks. Around the globe and at home, were training border enforcement officialsClas well as U.S. Customs inspectorsCIto thwart the smuggling of chemical, biological or nuclear
