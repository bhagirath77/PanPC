Renewing Your Vehicle Registration by Telephone Renew by calling DMV on a touchtone telephone and using a credit card to pay for your renewal transaction. We accept Visa, MasterCard,
Discover and American Express credit cards. The call is toll-free and takes less than five minutes. Before you dial: Review your pre-printed vehicle renewal notice that arrived in the mail. If
your address is incorrect on the notice, you can still use the touchtone system to renew. If any other information is incorrect, call DMV toll free at 1-866-DMVLINE (1-866-368-5463) or
1-800-435-5137. Speak with a DMV customer service agent and explain the incorrect information. Have your credit card and vehicle renewal notice handy when you call. If your vehicle
requires an emissions certificate at renewal time, have the certificate in front of you when you call. Dial toll-free 1-888-337-4782. You'll be greeted by an automated attendant. Follow the
instructions and enter your credit card number and other information using the keys on your touchtone phone. Be sure to use the pound key (#) and not the asterisk (*) key. You can renew
more than one vehicle when using the system. Simply follow the automated instructions. Multi-year discount: if you renew your vehicle registration for two years, you will receive a $2
discount. You can save even more by renewing your registration for three years and receive a $3 discount. Most customers receive their vehicle registration materials within five days, but U.S.
mail delivery times vary. Please allow 15 days to receive your decals before contacting DMV. | | | P.O. Box 27412 Richmond, VA 23269 1-866-DMV-LINE (1-866-368-5463) At DMV, we are
