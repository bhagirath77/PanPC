farmers markets all California Grown Farmers Market Seasonal Calendar This week's featured product is Kiwifruit. Originally called Chinese Gooseberries, these fuzzy Chinese natives were
transplanted to New Zealand by missionaries in the early 1900s and have since migrated to California, where they have flourished just like their vitamin C-rich cousins, citrus. For a quick
healthy snack, cut a kiwi in half and scoop out the green flesh and black seeds. Or peel, chop, and add to any salad. Or top chicken or fish with a fresh kiwifruit salsa. Since kiwifruit contains
acids that are natural tendetizers once exposed to the air, be sure to cut it right before eating and add it last to fruit salsas. Its unique flavor will add character and color to dishes. to find
