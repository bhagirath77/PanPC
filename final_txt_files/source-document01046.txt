Posted by webmestre on Mar 09, 2008 - 01:09 AM Ventral bone of the belt of the thoracic member (scapular), long bone. Characterized by: - its situation: under cutaneous (fracture attends)
@ - its direction obliques in crial, side, dorsal - its form in S Italic. The clavicle is located between the sternum and the acromion. Its Italic S curve increases its resistance (5 times more solid
than a simple rectilinear rod), this form is typical mankind. It has two curves. A convex curve into ventral close to the sternum, a concave curve into ventral close to the acromion into side. It
presents: - two iphyses - miale or sternale - side or acromiale. 1) The BODY flattened in tile present: - two faces (criale and caudal) - two edges (ventral and dorsal) a) Criale face convex,
smooth, under cutaneous, palpaple. b) Caudal face presence of several reliefs - average part: gouttie du muscle sub clavier. - miale part: print for the insertion of the ligament costo
claviculaire. - side part: print for insertions of the ligaments coraco-claviculaire with: - the tuber conoe - the trapezoidal line. c) Ventral edge curve identical to the clavicle in S Italic, into side
it presents the tuber deltoien. d) Bord Dorsal its curve is reversed, in its miale part it limits into ventral the procession costo-claviculaire giving passage to the vessels and the nerves of the
thoracic member. 2) EPIPHYSES a) Epiphyse Miale (sternale): bulky, it has an articular surface stemale divided into two: for the sternum in mial, for the first coast into side. b) Side Epiphyse
(acromiale): flattened, it has an articular surface acromiale for the acromion
