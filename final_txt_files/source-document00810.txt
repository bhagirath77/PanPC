the war. They started to fly mail and passengers domestically in Iceland, mostly with seaplanes. In 1947 Loftleidir bought their first intercontinental Airliners being a surplus Douglas C-54A
received from the USAF. Loftleidir started to offer low fares over the Atlantic, undercutting IATA (International Air Transport Association) prices. It must be sad that Loftleidir is the first carrier to
introduce low fares over the Atlantic, if not the first low fare carrier in the World. The business grew fast and Loftleidirs two C-54A's were inno way able to meet the demand. In 1959 Loftleidir
signed an agreement with Pan Am to buy five of their Douglas DC-6B. these planes were relatively new but available at a low price since Pan Am was moving into Jet age with their Boeing 707,
