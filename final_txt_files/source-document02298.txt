Posts: 422 Best Show: Experience: # of Shows: I love entertaining friends and family. My mother is an interior decorator and what I learned from her is to play around with things and don't
be afraid to move things around. Also think outside the box. I know that doesn't help too much. But my advice would be when you have some time to spare. Practice setting your table up with
the things you have and have fun with it. Another idea is to look through magazines and get ideas from there. I am constantly getting ideas from magaines and TV. I've made my own
tablecloths with just regular cheapo cloth I find at Hobby Lobby and I find a cute fringe which dresses it up alittle. And your Simple Additions will be a huge hit. Just display what you have. Use
the ideas that are on the little pamphlets that always come with an SA piece. Now would be a great time to have a party like this since the season is approaching when everyone is always

having company over. That is a terrific idea! I'll be thinking of some more ideas you can use. Hope I helped
