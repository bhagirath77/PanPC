Alias Permanent Hiatus She was a grad student who was a spy who worked for the good guys but were really the bad guys and then she worked for the good guys to bring down the bad guys
and when she finally got the bad guys all blowed up, she disappeared for two years, some dumb bitch showed up and stole her boyfriend and the whole show went all to hell. Yes, there were
still some good times -- the wigs, the stunts, the silly plots, the twitching of Spy Daddy's face -- but by the time we reached season five, we didn't give a damn anymore. And, thankfully,
neither did 33 Abrams or ABC because they finally wised the hell up and yanked this show off the air before it started full-on sucking. Hasta la vista, Spy Barbie! Ally McBeal Permanent Hiatus

It was an unfunny "comedy" about a "feminist icon" who wasn't. Ally McBeal had more tics and quirks than a Tourette's Ward, and it really started to suck as the years went on. Season 5
resulted in cancellation. No one was surprised. Dancing baby, wattles, bygones, et cetera. The shark, she is jumped
