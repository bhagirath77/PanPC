Overcoming the Fear of Selling For many of you the Fear of Selling is a huge challenge and obstacle for you from day to day. The first thing you need to do is find out exactly what it is you're
afraid of. Are you afraid of success? Believe it or not there this is an actual fear of some folks. Are you afraid of failure or rejection? Do you fear being perceived as being pushy? Do you
(secretly of course) fear that your product may not meet the expectations of your customer? You can't come up with a solution if you don't know what the problem is. There's a huge
misconception in direct sales being that you think you're imposing on your friends, family or just a customer in general. As long as you feel as though you're imposing...you are. You need to
love your product and feel as though you are offering a service. You're filling aneed. People are natural-born sellers. We just don't realize it when we're not making money from it. Let's say
you go to a movie that you loved and you have a friend that you know would enjoy it too. Wouldn't you recommend it to him/her? So why is it that as soon as we go into sales we
automatically feel as though we can recommend the products we sell. Why is it that we tend to feel guilty because wee going to make a profit off of it? If you are one that has a fear of
selling, take some time today to figure out the cause of your fear, and take action to fix it! ~~~~~~~ About the Authors: Kara Kelso & Anita DeFrank are two busy wahms, and the owners
