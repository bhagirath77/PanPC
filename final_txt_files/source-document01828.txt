Print this page Email this page How to Prevent or Delay Diabetes Pre-diabetes is a serious medical condition that can be treated. The good news is that the recently completed Diabetes
Prevention Program study conclusively showed that people with pre-diabetes can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes by making changes in their diet and increasing their level of
physical activity. They may even be able to return their blood glucose levels to the normal range. While the DPP also showed that some medications may delay the development of diabetes,
diet and exercise worked better. Just 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity, coupled with a 5-10% reduction in body weight, produced a 58% reduction in diabetes. The American
Diabetes Association is developing materials that will help people understand their risks for pre-diabetes and what they can do to halt the progression to diabetes and even to, "turn back the
clock." In the meantime, ADA has a wealth of resources for people with diabetes or at risk for diabetes that can be of use to people interested in pre-diabetes.
