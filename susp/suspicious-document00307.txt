potential side effects of the drug For joint range of motion during walking, the study was carried out on the person walking flat on the stairs. Joint movements were measured, it set the
range of motion of any joint. To determine the location of the center of gravity of each leg, the center of gravity of the human body is made for reference. To determine the ideal torque
exerted on the joints while Walking, Vamfrkim vectors measured during human walking and during the reaction and the occasional floor. Joints that allow limited motion or answer torsion
and compression by allowing "give" to prevent damage usually is. These separate classified into two different groups, symphyses and sychondroses. When two of the symphysis meets the
ceiling by hyaline cartilage. Fibrocartilage is then formed as a protective pad when saturated with hyaline cartilage collagen fibers. This form of protective padding provides protection
while allowing limited movement. The inter-vertebral joints formed by the inter-vertebral discs are a good example of this process and shared
