SLG&MS Lapidary and Show Building (view of front and show entrances) Main Offices of Searles Valley Minerals Company Trona, California For more than sixty five years, countless
thousands of visitors have come to Trona during the second weekend in October for the annual. And each year more collectors converge for the 36 hours of frantic, non-stop activity to collect
some of theGem-O-Rama best and most desirable evaporite mineral specimens in the world. Since the first show, the Searles Lake Gem and Mineral Society has worked closely with the
management and employees of the owner/operator on Searles Lake to provide one of the most exciting mineral collecting fieldtrips available in the world. These field trips and your
experiences would be impossible without their co-operation, dedicationand vision. If you visit Trona this year, please take time afterwards to write a short note of appreciation to Searles Valley
Minerals. Your letters will help ensure that this opportunity remains available for others. SVMC's address is: Searles Valley Minerals Corp
