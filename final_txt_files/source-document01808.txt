good and forbids evil to the amount of those three hundred and sixty joints, he walks on that Day (of Judgment) having distanced himself from the Fire." [1] Abu Buraydah (may Allah be
pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:"Man has three hundred and sixty joints. He has to give charity; one for each joint."The people said: "O Allah's Prophet!
