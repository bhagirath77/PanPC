In a medium mixing bowl combine the cheese, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. - Cover and chill until firm. - Cut an "x' in the top of each filet almost but not quite all the way through.
Open the "x" and stuff with 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture, pushing the cheese in well until level with the top of the steaks. - Cover and chill 15 minutes. To Make the Bordelaise Sauce
 - Combine the wine, thyme, and shallots in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. - Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to 1/4 cup. - Add the stock and
continue to simmer until reduced by half. - Remove the pan from the heat and reserve. To Cook the Steaks Preheat the oven to 400 F, and remove the steaks from the refrigerator. - Place a
large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, and heat until almost smoking. - Add the steaks, cut-side down, and sear 1 to 2 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a
spatula. - Make sure to scrape up the cheese crust with the steak when turning. - Remove the steaks from the saute pan to a sheet pan and place in the oven to finish. - Cook to desired
temperature, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. - While the steaks are finishing in the oven, finish the sauce. - Return the sauce to a low heat and gradually whisk in the butter, one
piece at a time, until the sauce is glossy. - Put a steak on each serving plate and surround the steaks with the sauce.
