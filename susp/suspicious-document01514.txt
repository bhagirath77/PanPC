can be phonologically short or long. Long (geminate) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark
shaddah, which indicates doubled consonants. In actual pronunciation, doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants. This consonant lengthening is phonemically
contrastive: "he accepted" vs. "he kissed."qabalaqabbala [] edit Syllable structure Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV) - and closed syllables (CVC). Every
syllable begins with a consonant, except in the case where the phrase begins with the definite article, for example, "the director" would be pronounced . When a word ends in a vowel and
the following word is the definite article, then the initial vowel of the article is elided and the consonant closes the final syllable of the preceding word, for example, "house (of) the
director," which becomes .[al mudi r]baytu | mudiirfbaytul mudi r] [] edit Stress Although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic, it does bear a strong
relationship to vowel length. The basic rules are: Only one of the last three syllables may be stressed. Given this restriction, the last "superheavy" syllable (containing a long vowel or
ending in a consonant) is stressed. If there is no such syllable, the pre-final syllable is stressed if it is 'heavy.' Otherwise, the first allowable syllable is stressed. In Standard Arabic, a
final long vowel may not be stressed. (This restriction does not apply to the spoken dialects, where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have
arisen.) For example: "book", "writer", "desk", "desks", "library", (MSA) "they wrote" = (dialect), (MSA) "they wrote it" = (dialect), (MSA) "they (dual, fem) wrote", (MSA) "I wrote" =
(dialect). Doubled consonants count as two consonants: "magazine",

"place". ki-TAA-bunkAA-ti-bunMAK-ta-bunma-KAA-ti-bunmak-TA-ba-tunKA-ta-buukA-ta-buka-ta-BUU-huka-ta-BUUka-TA-ba-taaka-TAB-tuka-TABTma-JAL-lama-HALL Some dialects have
different stress rules. In the Cairo () dialect, for example, a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence "school", "Cairo". In the Arabic of ,
stress is often retracted: "two houses", "their table", "desks", "sometimes", "their school". (In this dialect, only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a
two-syllable word, the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words, the final syllable cannot be stressed.) Egyptian Arabic mad-RA-saqaa-HI-ra

governed by a preposition]); three (singular, dual and plural); two (masculine and feminine); and three "states" (indefinite, definite, and ). The cases of singular nouns (other than those
that end in long ) are indicated by short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive). The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is reduced to /-ah/ or /-a/
before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the ) or internal modification (the ). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in "construct state and all nouns which
are by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred
to as or ). cases nominative accusative genitive numbers genders construct suffixed sound plural broken plural prefixed nunation tanw n Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person
(first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are in two major paradigms (termed and , or and ); two (active and passive); and five in the imperfective (, , , and ). There are also
two (active and passive) and a , but no . As indicated by the differing terms for the two tense systems, there is some disagreement over whether the distinction between the two systems
should be most accurately characterized as , or a combination of the two. The is constructed using fused suffixes that combine person, number and gender in a single morpheme, while the
aspect is constructed using a combination of (primarily encoding person) and (primarily encoding gender and number). The moods other than imperative are primarily marked by suffixes
(/u/ for indicative, /a/ for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, /an/ for energetic). The imperative has the endings of the jussive but lacks any prefixes. The passive is marked through
internal vowel changes. Plural forms for the verb are only used when the subject is not mentioned, or is preceding it, and the feminine singular is used for all non-human plurals
conjugated perfective imperfective past non-past voices moods indicative imperative subjunctive jussive energetic participles verbal noun infinitive tense aspect perfective aspect
imperfective prefixes suffixes in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. However, the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a
singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-ah/ or /-at/ suffix. Adjectives in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender. There are two varieties, independent pronouns
and . Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns. The first-person singular pronoun has a
different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/) and for nouns or prepositions (/- / after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels). Pronouns enclitics Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with
each other in all respects. However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular
regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement, in that grammatically
masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa. The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use
is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often
/bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite "nunation" and the internal passive. Modern Standard Arabic maintains the grammatical distinctions
of Literary Arabic except that the energetic mood is almost never used; in addition, Modern Standard Arabic sometimes drop the final short vowels that indicate case and mood. As in
many other Semitic languages, Arabic verb formation is based on a (usually) , which is not a word in itself but contains the semantic core. The consonants , for example, indicate , indicate
indicate , etc. Words are formed by supplying the root with a vowel structure and with affixes. (Traditionally, Arabic grammarians have used the root , , as a template to discuss word
formation.) From any particular root, up to fifteen different verbs can be formed, each with its own template; these are referred to by Western scholars as "form I", "form II", and so on
through "form XV". These forms, and their associated participles and verbal nouns, are the primary means of forming vocabulary in Arabic. Forms XI to XV are incidental. triconsonantal
