World," according to a boat ride tour which takes you throughout the world as animated characters dance and sing songs in their native tongues. To get there, you walk to the end of Main
Street or hop aboard the fire car, horse-drawn cart or train and proceed. Sleeping Beauty Castle is at the end of Main Street, beyond a bridge. Photo  Debbie Stock No child wants to leave
Disneyland without a hug from Mickey Mouse. He makes appearances throughout the park. Have you ever ridden a teacup? By putting your hands on the wheel and pushing or pulling, the
cup spins faster. Stop at Guest Relations as you enter the park to ask what time he'll be out with friends, Minnie, Pluto, Donald Duck and Goofy. Anaheim
