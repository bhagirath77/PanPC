Recycle Reuse I know that most of us save our plastic garbage bags to line our small trash cans but there has to be more that we can do with them. I am doing some research on creating
some things with them. My grandmother used to crochet bread bags into rugs and I remember thinking it was so neat that we could use the rugs outside and not have to worry about them
getting wet or dirty. I came across this website, www.myrecycledbags.com which has a myriad of things created from plastic bags. I particularly like this one (I am assuming that I am not very
good at adding links or perhaps unable to do it with the right name, but the link works!) This pattem is crocheted and is very practical and can be used for many trips to the market.

recycling becomes a much bigger deal in the lives of everyday people, please keep in mind that It has to be done correctly to continue its growth in acceptance and popularity. Many of the
larger retailers offer recycle containers on their property for public use, Please respect those businesses and those that empty the containers. Use them for the intended purpose and not a place
to get rid of your extra trash. Dont leave your stuff next to the cans,. If they are full wait until your next trip to the store to drop of your recycling, If the property is constantly trashed with
blowing paper and such, really how much good are we doing?
