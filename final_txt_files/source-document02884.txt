Saturninus Probus's Background M. Aurelius Probus was most likely born in Sirmium in 232 A.D. It is difficult to reconstruct Probus career before he became emperor because of the unreliable
nature of the account in the , but it is certainly possible that he was a tribune under . Perhaps all that can be said with any reliability is that he served in the military and was on staff during his
Eastern campaigns. There is a certain amount of confusion in the sources about him because of the fact that he has often been confused with a certain Tenagino Probus, who served as prefect
in Egypt under Historia Augusta Valerian Aurelian's [[1]] Claudius II Gothicus [[2]] Accession to Power After the murder of , the Senate chose as his successor the septuagenarian senator, ,
who took up the burdens of state and headed with the army to the East. The Eruli had overrun Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia and finally Cilicia, where , with help from his half-brother , defeated
them. , however, either died of an illness or was killed by his own troops; he was succeeded by . In the meantime, Probus had been declared Emperor by his own troops in mid-276, and
prepared to meet , who was marching from the Bosporus, having broken off his victorious engagement against the Eruli. was acknowledged in Rome and was supported by Gaul, Spain, Britain,
and Italy; Probus was supported by Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine and Egypt. The two fought a desultory campaign near Tarsus. With a much smaller force, Probus decided his best strategy would
be to avoid a pitched battle and let the heat overcome the troops of . The latter, having reigned barely two months, was murdered by his own troops. Probus became sole Emperor, possibly by
August 276. Aurelian Tacitus Tacitus Florianus [[3]] Tacitus Florianus [[4]] Florianus Florianus Florianus [[5]] [[6]] Probus in the West: 276-279 His first order of business was to punish the
murderers of , who may have also had a hand in the murder of . On the basis of numismatic evidence, Probus appears to have traveled from the east across the Propontis, and then through the
provinces of Thrace, Moesia and Pannonia. It is at this time that he must have defeated the Goths because he already had the title by 277 A.D. Shortly after he arrived at the Rhine River he
made a trip to Rome to have his powers ratified by the Senate. Aurelian Tacitus [[7]] Gothicus [[8]] Following the death of in 258, the situation in Gaul had rapidly deteriorated and numerous
bands of invaders had swept across the Rhine. In the south, the Longiones, together with the Alamanni, had advanced through the Neckar valley into Gaul. The Franks had crossed the Rhine
further north. In order to meet this simultaneous threat, Probus divided his forces having his generals campaign against the Franks, while he himself fought against the Longiones and
Alamanni. Both Probus and his generals were victorious; in fact, Probus even captured Semnon, the leader of the Longiones, with his son. Both groups of invaders agreed to terms and booty
and prisoners were returned; in the end, Probus allowed Semnon and his son their freedom. Postumus Probus is next reported to have fought victoriously against the Burgundians and to have
secured his victory with some ingenuity. Because his forces were smaller than those of the invaders, he wanted to engage the enemy on terms as favorable as possible; the Romans were on
one side of the river and the barbarians were on the other. Probus was able to induce them to cross the river by having his soldiers hurl insults at them, and being enraged, they began crossing
the river. Before the barbarians were able to organize themselves, the Roman army soundly routed them. Smarting from their defeat, the enemy did not live up to their end of the treaty, with
the result that, in a second battle, they were again worsted by Probus. The barbarians who were taken prisoner were enrolled in the Roman Army and sent to Britain. [[9]] Not content with
merely defeating the barbarians along the Rhine, Probus took important steps to secure the boundary for the future. He planned and constructed a series of forts and depots on the German
side of the Rhine at various crossing points, which he garrisoned with troops. Further, Probus apparently took measures to restore economic stability to Gaul by encouraging the planting of
vineyards. Probus' titles and suggest claims to the success of his operations in the area.Gothicus MaximusGermanicus Maximus [[10]] Events in the East 279-280 The sources do not give
many details of Probus's activities in Raetia and Illyricum, but Zosimus does say he repulsed an invasion of Vandals from Illyricum in a battle along a river generally identified as the Lech. In
279, theatre of operations was Lycia. Zosimus records the curious story of the adventures and death of a robber chieftain name Lydius who may be the same individual called Palfuerius in the
In order to prevent further troubles, Probus constructed fortresses, and settled large groups of veterans in this area, giving them land in exchange for the promise that their sons would also
serve in the legions when they were old enough.Historia Augusta [[11]] Probus's Military and Economic Activities In Egypt Meanwhile, Probus had sent his generals to Egypt, where the
Blemmyes were stirring up trouble in 280; they had broken through the border, advanced up the Nile, and, in league with the city of Ptolemais, captured the city of Koptus. They were
eventually expelled and order was restored by Probus' generals. Once Probus had restored order, he set about the task of a large-scale reconstruction of the dikes, canals, and bridges along the
Nile, something which not been done since it had been undertaken by Augustus in the years 27-25 B.C. More specifically, the notes, "On the Nile, moreover, he did so much that his sole efforts
added greatly to the tithes of grain. He constructed bridges and temples porticos and basilicas, all by the labour of the soldiers, he opened up many river-mouths, and drained many marshes,
and put in their place grain-fields and farms"(9.3-4). The importance of this type of work cannot be underestimated since a large percentage of the food supply for Rome came from Egypt and
the African provinces. Vita Probi [[12]] The Revolts of Proculus, Bonosus, and Satumninus According to the , although the Persian King, Vahram II, had made peaceful overtures, Probus had
rejected these and was planning to push the war forward when he was faced with a series of revolts both in the West and East. It is difficult to place them in their exact time-frame since the
sources do not agree. Nevertheless, the situation was serious enough for Probus to cancel his plans for war with Persia and hurry back to the West. On his return Probus settled large numbers
of barbarians in the Empire. Perhaps this was done to repopulate areas which had been left abandoned by the effects of invasions and plague. This policy, which Probus did not begin, and which
was continued by his successors was, however, destined to bring trouble to Rome in the future.Historia Augusta [[13]] The writer of the in the indicates that in 280 A.D. Proculus revolted in the
vicinity of the city of Lugdunum, which had been severely dealt with by and, for reasons not given, spurred on by this fear, had adopted a hostile attitude towards Probus. Proculus apparently
had some connections to the Franks and he had hoped to rally them to his cause. They appear, however, to have handed him over to Probus when he arrived on the scene. Probably at the same
time, Bonosus revolted. His rebellion seems to have been serious as it appears to have required considerable force to be suppressed. Bonosus, an officer in charge of the Rhine fleet, had
somehow let the Germans slip over the border and burn the fleet. Fearful of retribution, he apparently took shelter in proclaiming himself emperor. He was, in spite of his lapse with the fleet, an
excellent soldier. The fighting was only stopped when Bonosus, despairing of his position, hanged himself. Probus spared the lives of his sons as well as that of his wife. Vita ProbiHistoria
Augusta Aurelian [[14]] [[15]] Julius Satuminus, one of Probus 's commanders in Syria, probably seized power in the year 281. A close friend and associate of Probus, he may have been
compelled to adopt the purple by his unruly troops. Although he initially rejected a request of the people of Alexandria to put on the purple, he later changed his mind and proclaimed himself
Augustus. In any case, Probus planned to put down the rebellion. However, Saturninus was killed by his own troops before Probus had a chance to act. [[16]] The sources do not provide much
in the way of material to analyze the extent of these revolts and how widespread the feeling was against Probus in the West. There are indications that the revolts were more than local affairs
because inscriptions from as far away as Spain have been found where Probus's name has been erased. [[17]] In 281 Probus was in Rome to celebrate his victories. Although the goes into
great detail to describe the events of Probus triumph and celebrations of his victories in respect to the number of animals and prisoners involved, there may be some truth to its description
because Zosimus states there was a uprising which at this time required a force of soldiers to suppress. On a more substantial note, Probus completed the wall around Rome which had been
begun by .Historia Augusta Aurelian [[18]] Probus Assassination Probus was too anxious to push ahead with his plans for an invasion of Persia, which had been postponed due to the revolts
and unrest in the West, and, to this end, he left Rome in 282 and proceeded first to his native town of Sirmium when news came that , Perfect of the Guard, had been proclaimed emperor.
When troops sent by Probus to quell the rebellion went over to , Probus' remaining troops killed the emperor. His death occurred sometime between September or October 282. M. Aurelius

[[2]]The confusion in the may be intentional since Probus is the hero and his biographer certainly wanted to attribute as many valiant deeds to him as he could. The problem is carefully gone
over by A. Stein ("Tenagino Probus," , 29 [1936], 237-242). Stein gives documentary evidence for the career of T. Probus as well as the name Tenagino (which he says is Etruscan in origin).
