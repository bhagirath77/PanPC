View Bibliography President James Buchanan, Excerpt, First Annual Message, Dec. 8, 1857. ...With all other European Governments, except that of Spain, our relations are as peaceful as we

could desire. I regret to say that no progress whatever has been made since the adjournment of Congress toward the settlement of any of the numerous claims of our citizens against the
Spanish Government. Besides, the outrage committed on our flag by the Spanish war frigatea on the high seas off the coast of Cuba in March, 1855, by firing into the American mail steamer
and detaining and searching her, remains unacknowledged and unredressed. The general tone and temper of the Spanish Government toward that of the United States are much to be
regretted. Our present envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Madrid has asked to be recalled, and it is my purpose to send out a new minister to Spain with special instructions on
all questions pending between the two Governments, and with a determination to have them speedily and amicably adjusted if this be possible. In the meantime, whenever our minister urges
the just claims of our citizens on the notice of the Spanish Government he is met with the objection that Congress has never made the appropriation recommended by President Polk in his
annual message of December, 1847, "to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the case. " A similar recommendation was made by my
immediate predecessor in his message of December, 1853, and entirely concurting with both in the opinion that this indemnity is justly due under the treaty with Spain of the 27th of October,

1795, I earnestly recommend such an appropriation to the favorable consideration of Congress. Source:, Washington., D. C., 1898 (vol. 5). Richardson, James D., ed. Ferrolanael
