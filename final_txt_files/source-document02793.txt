Dialogue with the Director Appraisals & Appraisers The Museum and museum staff are prohibited from offering valuations, appraisals or authentications for works of art. Appraisals and
authentication should be carried out by a certified appraiser or reputable auction house. You may wish to find an appraiser to determine the value of your artwork. Appraisers are trained
specialists who work for a fee. They evaluate your piece and give you a written statement of its value. Although the following organizations do not provide appraisals themselves, they each
publish a directory of their members. Always seek an appraiser with an expertise in the type of artwork you own. Appraisers listed in these directories can be found by state and city. You may
also find appraisers listed in the Yellow Pages of your local phone directories.
