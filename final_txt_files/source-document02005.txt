Update Your Profile As part of the County's emergency planning and response system, the Department of Health Services has developed a community volunteer health service corps, known as
the Medical Reserve Corps. This group consists of trained health care professionals, such as nurses, physicians, and pharmacists, mental health professionals, such as psychologists, social
workers, family therapists, and psychiatric technicians, and non-medical community members, who desire to serve as volunteers in our community during health-related emergencies. What is,
the Medical Reserve Corps? The primary mission of the Sonoma County MRC has been to recruit and train health care professionals for staffing mass vaccination and prophylactic medication
dispensing sites in the event of a public health disaster. As the Sonoma County MRC prepares to enter its sixth year, its mission has broadened to include offering surge personnel to hospitals,
alternate care sites, and others in the event of a large health emergency. Roles will be defined with the help of our community planning partners, and Public Health will facilitate training and
exercises. The following links are provided to help volunteers learn more about the Medical Reserve Corps program. Source: Office of the Surgeon General, Department of Health and Human
