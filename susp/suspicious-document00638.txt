including A wide range of national security (such as "cyber security", ports of entry), the environment (for example, carbon management, science of underground) and energy (for
example, network management). The range of products offers its customers complex environmental problems related to chemistry, hazardous or radioactive characterization materials,
facilities and site management, restoration, institutional matters and management of natural resources. These organizations need to mitigate environmental pollution, waste and resource
management problems or conduct research to better understand the chemical, biological and physical properties that affect the environment. The lessons of fossils will help students
understand that fossils provide evidence of plants, animals and environments that existed long ago as well as understanding that animal and plant species change over time. We

information than ever, but it lacked the tools to manage and assimilate the vast quantity and variety of information. Most of the data was in the form of text, but in different models for
different purposes, which could not be treated in an information content reliably. The Department of Energy (DOE) manages the federal investment in SSL research and development to
advance the technology and realize its proposed energy efficiency, lighting service and economic benefits. DOE has developed a comprehensive program to support effective marketing and
implementation of SSL on the lighting market. This program includes, and to recognize and reward excellence in the application of this emerging technology. Intended to replace the
