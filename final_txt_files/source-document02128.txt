 The sports world changed forever as ESPN aired its first program at 7 p.m. ET on Sept. 7, 1979. With George Grande and Lee Leonard hosting, the show was the first of more than 30,000
and counting. SportsCenter's first show was highlighted by a live remote interview with University of Colorado football coach Chuck Fairbanks. Although the live feed from Boulder, Colo., had
video but no audio, the show's innovation foreshadowed a bright future. With a multimillion-dollar broadcast operations center in Bristol, Conn., that had two 10-meter satellite earth stations,
ESPN was in nearly 4 million households by the end of the year. Within the first month of the show, ESPN had hired Bob Ley and Chris Berman as hosts. Along with others, Ley and Berman
helped usher in a new generation of sports fans. Both men still work for ESPN, making contributions to SportsCenter, the longest-running sports news show on television. Alongside
SportsCenter, ESPN became an innovator in its ability to provide fans with coverage from many games. ESPN's first sporting event was the Slo-Pitch Softball World Series between the
Milwaukee Schlitz and the Kentucky Bourbons. Programming through the rest of the year included 50 college football games, 26 soccer games and various other events such as tennis Davis
Cup. The network reached an agreement with the NCAA on March 1 for exclusive rights to televise select events and presented an exhibition on the USA hockey team as it prepared for the
1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. ANCHORS OF THE '70s Grande appeared alongside Lee Leonard on SportsCenter, the first ESPN telecast, on Sept. 7, 1979. Lee Leonard Leonard
