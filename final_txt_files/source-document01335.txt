important aspect of our business. We strive to create a well-balanced relationship between our staff and you, the customer. We appreciate all of the business our loyal customers have given us
in the past and look forward to creating new long lasting opportunities in the future. Bobcat of Connecticut opened its doors with 5 employees in Hartford, CT in December, 1990. After being in
business for three years, a branch was added in Stratford, CT. That branch was later moved to a new, larger location located at 821 Woodend Ave, Stratford. In August of 1998 we moved out
of our Hartford location to a new and improved building located at 54 Alna Ln, East Hartford, CT. August of 1999 saw Bobcat of Connecticut grow again, with the opening of Bobcat of Greater
Springfield, in Chicopee, MA. In 2007, the store was moved to a larger facility located in West Springfield, MA. Our current product line includes Bobcat Skid Steer, Track Loaders, Excavators,
Utility Vehicles, Tractor, Versahandlers, and the full line of Bobcat Attachments. We are also an authorized dealer for Fecon Forestry Products, Protech Snow Pushers, Towmaster Trailers, and
many other product lines. We have enjoyed continued growth in the past, currently operating with 3 locations and over 40 employees, and look forward to the future. Bobcat of Connecticut
