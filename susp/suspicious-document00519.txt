[] edit Overview All can be considered part of brain mapping. Brain mapping can be conceived as a higher form of , producing brain images supplemented by the result of additional
(imaging or non-imaging) data processing or analysis, such as maps projecting (measures of) behaviour onto brain regions (see ). neuroimaging neuroimaging fMRI Brain Mapping
techniques are constantly evolving, and rely on the development and refinement of image acquisition, representation, analysis, and interpretation techniques. Functional and structural are
at the core of the aspect of Brain Mapping. visualization neuroimaging mapping [] edit History In the late 1980s in the United States, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
Science was commissioned to establish a panel to investigate the value of integrating neuroscientific information across a variety of techniques. [1] Of specific interest is using structural
and functional magnetic resonance imaging (), electroencephalography (), (PET) and other non-invasive scanning techniques to map , , , function and of the human brain. Both healthy and
brains may be mapped to study , , , and effects in various populations such as people with , , and . This led to the establishment of the Human Brain Project. fMRI EEG positron emission
