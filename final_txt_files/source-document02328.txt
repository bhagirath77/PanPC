One Ton 109" Land-Rovers 1969-77 The One Ton model was launched in September 1968 as an uprated version of the (3/4 ton) 109" Long Wheelbase Series Ila Land Rover. The vehicle was
specified with the 2.6 litre six cylinder petrol engine, and the gearbox from the IIb forward control. The axles were heavy-duty ENV units (also used on the 101 FC). From around 1972, the
Series III One Ton models had front and rear Salisbury axles, and later still the front diff became the standard Rover unit. The chassis was an upgraded reinforced item, featuring drop shackle
suspension as pioneered on military vehicles. The 9.00x16 tyres on deep dish rims were carried over from the IIb forward control. Longer brake pipes were fitted as well as a brake servo, the
front brakes being wider than standard with 3" shoes. Production got underway properly in April 1969 when vehicle number two was built, and all these vehicles had the headlamps in the
wings, in line with standard Ila vehicles from that period. When production moved on to the series III in September 1971, 170 One Ton Series Ila vehicles had been built. Production of the
Series III One Tons is thought to stand at around 235 vehicles. The TACR I airfield fire truck was based on One Ton specs. The One Ton Land Rover and One Tonne' Land Rover are very
different vehicles, the one tonne being the 101 FC.
