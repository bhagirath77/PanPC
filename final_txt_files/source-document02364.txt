book e.Deceived on PurposeThe Purpose Driven Lif Smith takes the reader into the inner workings of todays evangelical world as he explores the questionable interconnections of several of its
top leaders. As Rick Warren goes worldwide with his purpose-driven Global Peace Plan, Smith presents an in-depth examination of this mega-church pastor's spiritual agenda. He explains how
Rick Warren's Peace Plan could eventually merge with the New Age Peace Plan that is being similarly presented by key New Age leaders. Smith contends that Crystal Cathedral Pastor and New
Age sympathizer Robert Schuller has had a great influence on Rick Warren's teachings and that Schullers influence can be found throughout Rick Warren's book . Smith writes, "The more I read
Robert Schuller, the more I was shocked at how so many of Rick Warren's thoughts, ideas, references, words, terms, phrases, and quotes in seemed to be inspired by Schullers writings and
teachings".The Purpose-Driven LifeThe Purpose-Driven Life Smiths distinctive background as a former New Age follower who has converted to biblical Christianity gives him a uniquely objective
perspective as both an outsider and an insider. He draws deeply from his extensive knowledge of the New Age subculture that is now being subtly woven into the Christian church by Rick
Warren and other Christian leaders. Smith believes that wittingly or unwittingly, Rick Warren is walking the church into a spiritual trap. This exceptional book is sure to appeal to a wide-ranging
audience. Anyone who desires to know how the evangelical and New Age plans are moving toward oneness will find this book to be especially insightful. Smiths easy-going style makes this a
fast-paced read
