people in middle school through high school are welcomed to volunteer at the library. Please call the library to make arrangements with the Branch Librarian. Contributions The library
gratefully accepts donations in the form of money, books, memorial or honor books and other donations to enhance library services. Donations in honor or in memory of friends and loved
ones are gratefully accepted by the library. At your request, each gift book donated or purchased with your donation will have a special bookplate which gives the name of the person to
whom the book is dedicated and the name of the donor. The library gladly accepts donations of books, DVDs, audio materials and other items with the understanding that the items may
be used in the library collection, used for whatever best serves the library or donated to the Friends of the Library for their future use. We do ask that the items be in fair condition. Upon
request, the library will be happy to provide written acknowledgement of your donation. Items may not be left outside the library but must be delivered during hours the library is open.
Friends of the Charles H. Stone Memorial Library Charles H. Stone Memorial Library does not currently have a Friends of the Library group. Anyone who is interested in participating in or
organizing such a group is encouraged to contact the Branch Librarian. We would certainly welcome one!
