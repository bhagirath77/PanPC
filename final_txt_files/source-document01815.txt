Bodum took over a small clarinet factory in Normandy in 1982 it was not because of the fine orchestra clarinets they were producing but because of a relatively unknown coffee maker called
the Chambord which they, by coincidence, produced as well. Bodum combined the skills of these Normandy craftsmen with modern production to produce this unique coffee maker, known as
the French press coffee brewer. Thanks to Bodum and the increasing need for better coffee, the French press coffee maker became one of the most popular coffeemakers in the world. The
design has not changed a bit from the original drawings and Bodum still makes the Chambord with the same painstaking care and knowledge they have learned from those proud craftsmen in
windy Normandy. The ease of brewing and the delicious smell and taste of French roasted dark coffee have not changed. Made of sturdy glass, with a chrome plated brass frame and a stainless
steel mechanism. Dishwasher safe.51 oz
