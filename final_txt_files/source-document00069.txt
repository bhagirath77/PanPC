Land Rover Series I (1904 - 1963) was the chief designer at the British car company at the end of , responsible for the development of the utility vehicle. He discovered a need for the vehicle
when using his own , (an old war jeep) on his farm in . Parts for this were available but could only be bought in bulk due to the army's overproduction of parts during the war. Wilks then
decided, along with his brother , the general manager at during this time, that Rover should invest in an off road utility vehicle for farmers. Thus, the Land Rover was born. His first Land Rover
was made in 1947, a hybrid built on a Jeep chassis using a Rover car engine and gearbox but retaining the Jeep transmission. This first prototype had a centrally mounted steering wheel so
that the driver sat astride the gearbox rather like driving a tractor. The Rover company then authorised the production of 50 pre-production models (48 were actually built of which about half
still survive) built entirely in-house, the steering now conventionally mounted for left or right hand drive. Actual production models began to roll off the lines, painted a light shade of green
said to be from a surplus stock of aircraft cockpit paint, in mid 1948. This 80" wheelbase model is now known as the first of the 'Series 1' Land Rovers.Maurice Cary Ferdinand Wilks Rover World
