Today ESPN IS the biggest thing in sports! Hear how it happened from one of the indomitable entrepreneurs in the history of our country. Looking back, sports 24-hours a day seemed like
such an obviously successful idea just waiting to happen, that one wonders why SI even bothered with the conditional "...may become..." comment, but therein lies the tale. There were no
24-hour networks back in 1979 - not ABC, CBS, NBC, not even HBO. Fox hadn't been thought of - even CNN and MTV hadn't gotten off the mark when ESPN debuted at 7:00 PM, Friday,
September 7, 1979. Having been fired by The New England Whalers in May 1978, and armed with a $9,000 credit card cash advance, enough cable TV knowledge to be a little dangerous, and
no knowledge whatsoever about communications satellites, a fierce entrepreneurial spirit and little else, Bill Rasmussen started the journey that led to the launch of ESPN on September 7,
1979, Bill's recounting of the events, the people, and the challenges met and overcome is inspiring and motivating as well as entertaining. (Example - Question: Why did TV Guide refuse to list
ESPN programs? Answer: Networks only have three letters!) If you're searching for just the right speaker of interest...the speaker with whom your audience will quickly relate&a speaker that
has made a difference in our world, schedule Bill. Learn about ESPN's history, of course, and see, feel and experience the indomitable American entrepreneurial spirit that spawned ESPN - The
Worldwide Leader in Sports. Make your next event one for the ages!!
