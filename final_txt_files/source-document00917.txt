[] edit Origins After building a series of compact cars, DAF sought a partner to bring its new larger model, codenamed P900 and intended to become the DAF 77, to market in 1970. Several
manufacturers were approached, including , , and Volvo. Volvo was not originally interested due to the cost, but they were later persuaded by DAF's access to engines. This helped Volvo expand
its model line-up without the large expenditures associated with developing a new model. Building cars in the also helped the Volvo to access the markets of the , of which Sweden was then not
yet a member. Audi BMW Renault Netherlands Swedish EEC Volvo purchased a one-third share in DAF in 1973, increasing to a three-quarters stake in 1975; the DAF company's name was
changed to Volvo Car BV that year. Free of its passenger car division, DAF's commercial vehicle division, , still operates today. DAF Trucks [] edit Model chronology 343 DL, 1980 model (before
first bumper and front facelift) The Volvo 343 was introduced in 1976. DAF had already begun development of this car as a replacement for the . It was fitted with a 1.4 litre Renault engine in
the front and DAF's radical unusually mounted in the rear, helping weight distribution. The car didn't sell well with this transmission on the "shifthappy" European market, and sales only really
started to take off when a manual transmission from the was made available in 1979. A five-door model, the 345, was added in 1980. In around 1980 also larger wrap around bumpers were
introduced. 1981 saw the addition of an additional engine option, the 2.0 litre B19A unit, again from the Volvo 240, only available with the manual gearbox. These models were designated the
DLS and GLS, whilst the 1.4 litre engine was only available in L, DL and GL form. A more streamlined bonnet, grille and front lamp arrangement and slightly different fenders signalled a facelift
in 1982, which also gave the car a new dashboard and revised interior. Volvo (previously DAF) 66 Variomatic continuously variable transmission 200 series 360 saloon, 1985 model (before
facelift) The third digit designating the number of doors was dropped from model designations in 1983. The 343 DLS and GLS were renamed the 360, which arrived that year with two 2.0 litre
engine choices, the 92 bhp (69 kW) 819A, and the fuel injected115 bhp (86 kW) B19E for the flagship model, the 360 GLT. The 360 model was available in five-door and three-door hatchback
form, with four-door saloon models added in 1984, as were the 340's. In around 1985 a further facelift was introduced. Amongst other small changes, wrap-around body coloured bumpers
with the indicator repeaters attached to them were fitted. Instrumentation changed from Smiths units to VDO. The older Volvo red block engines in the 360 were upgraded to the low friction
8200 unit. Capacities and outputs remained much the same. The carbed version was designated B200K and the Bosch LE-Jet fuel injected version is known as the B200E. Also, the manual 340
models were now available with the 8172 Renault F-series 1.7 litre engine. From 1987 on, incremental improvements in features and emissions control were made. Production of the 300 series
ended in 1991, despite the fact it was supposedly replaced by the in 1987. Volvo 440 A famous advertisement for the 300 series in the late 1980s saw a "come alive", and drive a 340 out of a
second floor factory window, nose-diving into the concrete ground. crash test dummy [] edit Engines The 300 Series had a choice of three petrol engines; a 1.4, 1.7, and a2 litre. The 1.4 litre
B14 was a 72 bhp (54 kW) C-series pushrod unit, and for the DLS, GLS and 360 there was the 2 litre engine taken from the , with outputs varying from 95 bhp (71 kW) to 112 bhp (84 kW). A
new Renault F-series 80 bhp (60 kW) 1.7 litre petrol engine (designated the 8172) was introduced in the 340 during the late 1984 range facelift. Renault OHV B200 Volvo 240 OHC Volvo 360
GLT 1987 and 1988 A diesel engine was added to the 340 models in 1986. This diesel was a F series like the petrol 1.7, and was available with a 55 bhp (41 kW) 1.6-litre non-turbo engine
only. These diesel models were never offered in form, and hence were never officially exported to right-hand drive markets such as the . Renault right-hand drive UK [] edit Reputation and
popularity Like other Volvos, the 340 embodied many ground-breaking safety features which have since become standard on most cars.[] citation needed While the car was fundamentally
robust, the detail build quality was never up to the same standard of Volvo's larger, Swedish-built models, coupled to the fact that the early Variomatic cars proved to be particularly
troublesome. The Volvo badge however ensured that the car had a strong middle-class following (often as a second car) particularly in the UK in the 1980s, being the nation's eighth best selling
new car in 1982 and the tenth in 1983 and 1984. They are robust and mechanically simple (and therefore easy to maintain). Even the unpopular Variomatic transmissions are reliable given
proper care. The rust protection was poorer than other Volvos, but the engines (especially the 1.4 and 2.0's) were quite durable.[] citation needed An unusual feature of the car's design is the
geometry of the rear axle. Two degrees of negative camber on the rear axle produces a similar stabilising effect as the expensive and complex launched by a year after the launch of the Volvo
343, The inherent stability of this design made the car popular with caravan owners, being voted in 1985. de Dion Weissach axle Porsche Tow Car of the Year{] citation needed The
Renault-sourced 1.7 litre engine suffers from a well-known problem where the carburettor mounting flange warps due to engine heat, causing a small air leak and subsequent running

problems. This is easy, if expensive, to fix. The Volvo 300 has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years with a number of very active websites across Europe. A strong, young
following has developed attracted by a rear wheel drive car which is very cheap to buy, insure and relatively easy to work on. In the UK, despite being unsuitable for professional , because of its
low price, many 300s has found its popularity amongst the amateur drifting community known as "trampdrifting which old bangers are modified to drift at a minimal cost and is discarded once
it reaches its end of life. drifting It featured among the top 10 most popular new cars in the UK in 1982, 1983 and 1984, and was one of the UK's most popular imported cars of the decade. It
