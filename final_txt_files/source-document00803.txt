All of the below establishments are located on the one and only Rua das Pedras. A traditional Buzio spot, Au Cheval Blanc offers a wonderful sushi bar facing the street and a pleasant restaurant
inside which faces the gorgeous Armacao beach. To satisfy your sweet tooth, a favorite dessert is the chocolate souffle, but order this early, for it takes 40 minutes to prepare! This place not
only serves delicious drinks and crepes, but, since its opening 16 years, it has become the prime meeting location for endless interesting and cultured people. As it also holds various shows and
theater performances, it is infused with culture throughout the years that reflects the interests of its guests. This is the premium restaurant to enjoy international cuisine, with delicious
Argentine grilled meats and wines. There are also live Tango shows held, along with other events. This might be the epitome of the Buzios, though, with so many amazing locations in Buzios,
who can truly make that decision? This spot cannot be categorized under one section; Ithas delicious dining options in the Bistro, with several ocean-facing tables and a large selection of wines.
Yet it also has wonderful live music -ranging from Samba to Choro to Blues - a pool table, Salsa dancing, and many other shows! There is also a Jazz and Blues festival held there in July. Let
