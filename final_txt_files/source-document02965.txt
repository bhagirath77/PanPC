upgrade Steven H. Schwartz & Associates, P.L.C. Michigan Minimum Wage Law Schipper | 01 November, 2006 12:06 The Michigan minimum hourly wage is to increase to $6.95 on October 1,
2006, to $7.15 beginning July 1, 2007, and to $7.40 beginning July 1, 2008.Because of interplay between the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") and Michigan Wage & Hour Law,
practitioners generally agreed that several classes of previously exempt status employees would be considered non-exempt, eligible for overtime, employees because of the minimum hourly
wage amendments to the Michigan law. However, recent legislation mostly avoids this outcome. The Governor has signed legislation that largely maintains the classes of exempt and
non-exempt employees as they applied before the minimum wage increases; except for some classes of home health care providers, childcare providers, and agricultural workers. While the
amendment to the Michigan law relieves some employers of overtime responsibility, employers would be well advised to review their employees exemption status under Michigan law.
