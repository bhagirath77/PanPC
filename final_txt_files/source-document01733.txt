Over Next Decade Almost Two-thirds of Tax Cuts Would Go to Best-off 10% Click here to see a related CT analysis of the composition of the federal tax burden by income level. Anew
analysis of the 10% income tax rate cut proposed by House and Senate leaders shows that the plan would reduce federal revenues by more than a trillion dollars over the next decade. The
analysis also shows that 62% of the proposed tax cuts would go to the best-off tenth of all taxpayers. The computer analysis of the proposed 10% income tax rate reduction was released by
Citizens for Tax Justice, a non-partisan, non-profit group that favors fairer tax policies. The analysis also found: "The proposed 10% income tax rate cut is billed as an even-handed tax cut, but
that's not the case at all," noted CTI director Robert S. McIntyre. "In fact, this plan would reduce the federal government's most progressive tax, the income tax, while leaving other, generally
regressive taxes in place. That approach, by definition, has to favor the best-off taxpayers at the expense of everyone else." Estimated Revenue Effects of a 10% Cut in Personal Income Tax
