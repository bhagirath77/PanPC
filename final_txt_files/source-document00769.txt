Starbucks Card A Brief History of Starbucks Starbucks has always been a place where you can find the worlds best coffees. But in 1971, you would have had to travel all the way to our only
store in Seattle's historic Pike Place Market. The first Starbucks opens. The name comes from Herman Melville's Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century whaling industry.
The seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world's finest coffees to the cold, thirsty people of Seattle.1970s Howard Schultz joins Starbucks in 1982. While on a
business trip in Italy, he visits Milans famous espresso bars. Impressed with their popularity and culture, he sees their potential in Seattle. Hes right ~ after trying lattes and mochas, Seattle
