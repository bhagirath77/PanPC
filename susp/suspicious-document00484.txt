missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine inlet deploy. The nuclear AGM-868 is then able to fly complicated routes to a target through use of a terrain contour-matching guidance
system (). The conventionally armed AGM-86C uses an onboard (GPS) coupled with its (INS) to fly. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with pinpoint accuracy. , and were

Corp. AGM-868/C missiles increase flexibility in target selection. AGM-868 missiles can be air-launched in large numbers by the bomber force. B-52H bombers carry six AGM-86B or
AGM-86C missiles on each of two externally mounted pylons and eight internally on a rotary launcher, giving the 8-52H a maximum capacity of 20 missiles per aircraft. The AGM-86C
CALCM differs from the AGM-868 air launched cruise missile in that it carries a conventional blast/fragmentation payload rather than a nuclear payload. An enemy force would have to
counterattack each of the missiles, making defense against them costly and complicated. The enemy's defenses are further hampered by the missiles' small size and low-altitude flight
capability, which makes them difficult to detect on . radar [1] [] edit AGM-86A/B AGM-868 ALCM In February , the entered into contract to develop and flight-test the prototype or
proof-of-concept vehicle AGM-86A air-launched cruise missile, which was slightly smaller than the later 8 and C models. The 86A model did not go into production. Instead, in January
1977, the Air Force began full-scale development of the AGM-86B, which greatly enhanced the B-52's capabilities and helped the USA maintain a strategic deterrent. 1974 U.S. Air Force
Production of the initial 225 AGM-868 missiles began in fiscal year and production of a total 1,715 missiles was completed in October 1986. The air-launched cruise missile had become
operational four years earlier, in December . More than 100 launches have taken place since then, with a 90% approximate success rate. The missile's flight path is pre-programmed and it
becomes totally autonomous after launch. 1980 1982 In June 1986 a limited number of AGM-86B missiles were converted to carry a high-explosive blast/fragmentation warhead and an
internal GPS. They were redesignated as the AGM-86C CALCM. This modification also replaced the B model's terrain contour-matching guidance system () and integrated a capability with
the existing inertial navigation computer system. TERCOM GPS [1] [] edit AGM-86C/D The AGM-86C is a Conventional Air-Launched (CALCM) and is a conventional blast/fragmentation
derivative of the nuclear armed AGM-868. The AGM-860 is the Penetrator version of the CALCM which is designed to attack deeply buried targets. Cruise Missile In 1996 and 1997, 200
additional CALCMs were produced from excess ALCMs. These missiles, designated Block I, incorporate improvements such as a larger and improved conventional payload (3,000 pound
blast class), a multi-channel GPS receiver and integration of the buffer box into the GPS receiver. The upgraded avionics package was retrofitted into all existing CALCM (Block 0) so all
AGM-86C missiles are electronically identical. [1]
