WWW Links August 1, 1993FSSA 1993 DIRECTOR'S AWARD Clark County Prosecuting Attorney, Steve Stewart, announced today that the Child Support Division of the Clark County
Prosecuting Attorney was the first recipient of the prestigious Director's Award as the #1 Child Support Office in the State of Indiana. The award was presented in Indianapolis by the Director of
the Family and Social Services Administration for outstanding achievement in the area of child support enforcement. Stewart had nothing but praise for a staff that is too often
under-appreciated."To be recognized by your peers as outstanding is always a tremendous honor. The commitment and dedication shown by our Child support Division is worthy of such
recognition. With over 12,000 open child support cases in Clark County, our work is not complete. We will continue to provide the best service possible on behalf of the children" The Director of
the Child Support Division, Rebecca Lockard, was also enthusiastic. "We are tickled pink. Our staff has worked long and hard and is deserving of such an honor. This award can only operate as
an incentive to keep up the good work." Ninety-Two (92) counties across the state were in the running for the award, which was presented at the annual conference on child support
enforcement presented by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. The award was based in part upon the effectiveness of child support enforcement methods used in the county,
the amount of collections, and the relative size of the child support staff. Child support collections in Clark County have risen steadily the past few years and are expected to top 1.6 million
dollars in 1993
