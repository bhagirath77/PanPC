Enlarge View Introduction The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Academies for creating Teacher Scientist (ACTS) Science Alive Program at Pacific Northest National Laboratory (PNNL) was a
three-year teacher academy for elementary teachers. The Academy's goal was to enhance the teachers scientific literacy and deepen their understanding of the nature of science. This project
was made possible with funds from the U.S. DOE Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists. During the three-year program, teachers developed lesson
enhancements aligned with the National Science Education Standards and Washington State Essential Academic Learning Requirements to fill gaps in the existing curricular materials. Armed
with a "need to know" about earth and environmental science, the teacher leaders set out to increase their own understanding of earthquakes, volcanoes, fossils and energy flow through
natural systems. They were immersed in an adult learning experiences that aligned with science curriculum/learning resources. From the edge of the crater of Mt. St. Helens to the fossil beds
of the John Day, the teacher leaders learned first-hand as they deepened their geoscience and environmental science content knowledge under the mentorship of the PNNL scientists, Janelle
Downs, Shannon Goodwin, Duane Horton and Steve Reidel. The and Lessons were developed by: Earth Changes Fossil & , Kennewick School District & , Sunnyside School District , Art and
