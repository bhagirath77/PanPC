Statistics On a broader scale, the Technical Networks are being implemented Battelle-wide in the private Battelle laboratory in Columbus, Ohio and in the other National Laboratories where
Battelle Memorial Institute leads or shares laboratory management responsibilities under contract with the US Department of Energy. The technical networks nurture communication and
encourage collaboration across organizational and geographic boundaries, facilitating the sharing of information on the deployment of state-of-the-art tools, methods, and equipment. Technical
networks also facilitate the alignment of Battelle-wide capabilities with the business strategies of our organizations and their businesses. In addition, technical networks provide a holistic
approach to stewardship for Battelle's diverse intellectual assets. These approaches enable greater advancement of our collective science and technology capabilities and the supporting
infrastructure. For affiliated Department of Energy laboratories, these approaches also facilitate coordination of programmatic directions and research and development. The collective set of
technical networks involves staff across five Battelle-managed sites: Battelle Columbus Laboratory (Columbus, Ohio), Brookhaven National Laboratory (Islip, New York), National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (Golden, Colorado), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, Tennessee), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Richland, Washington). Sensors & Electronics
