an important component of hemoglobin, the oxygen is transported in the blood to various parts of the body. It also plays a vital role in many metabolic reactions. Iron deficiency can
lead to anemia resulting in a low level of hemoglobin in the blood. Iron deficiency is the most common mineral nutrients In the UK and around the world. Functional iron is essential to the
formation of hemoglobin, the red pigment in the blood. Irish Haemochromatosis Association Irish Haemochromatosis Association aims to support and provide information for people
with hemochromatosis and related disorders in order to facilitate networking among members, and a newsletter, Brochures, and other members of the extended families through the
production of the screening is to encourage the media to provide information and raise awareness of haemochromatosis.1 The. Bank2 a membership form. The general public and

lactoferrin makes not only the iron is absorbed from food easily assimilated by the human body (iron deficiency), but also deprived of infectious organisms are needed this crucial
element of their survival and growth. Storage of iron content affect iron absorption. Iron absorption, low body reserves. When high iron stores, in order to reduce iron overload

day), a chronic treatment, which may take 3-6 months. Under certain conditions (as described later), and that of the production complex), or even iron replacement is necessary. This
can then lead to liver cancer and death if the disease is not diagnosed and treated. And the liver disease and other serious diseases caused by excess iron: in the general population in
Australia is at least one person in 300 is likely to be affected by hemochromatosis during his life away. Women are also at risk than men, but the disorder tends to occur later in life lost

synthesis of proteins to transport oxygen from hemoglobin and Myoglobin, and enzymes for the formation of heme containing enzymes and other Fe, involved in electron transfer and
reduction-oxidation reactions ... Regulation of iron metabolism by controlling absorption rather modifying excretion as most other metals, increases and decreases of absorption during
erythropoiesis, when the deficit [production of RBCs] is pressed. The body has a limited ability to excrete excess Fe and than saved needs ... Iron deficiency is probably fairly common
in the general population and a 1985 survey of young British omnivorous women showed that on average, only about half of the current recommended intake to consume. The dietary
and nutritional survey of British adults showed that one-third of the women had low iron levels. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue and shortness of breath, especially
during physical exertion, dizziness, heart palpitations, headaches and poor concentration. Babies, toddlers, preschoolers and adolescents are at greater risk of iron deficiency due to
increased iron needs can not be satisfied if their diet is not balanced. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in children starts with diet change, but may include iron supplements (under
medical supervision only). Date: Better Health Channel Description: Causes of iron deficiency in adults include inadequate dietary intake, chronic blood loss (through menstruation or
other causes), periods of increased need such as pregnancy, inability to absorb or use iron properly and vigorous exercise. I am a former employee of Wellsphere. Robin Perryville,
