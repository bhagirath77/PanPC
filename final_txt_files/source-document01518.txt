universityOs exceptional courses, professors and university policies . For example, he was able to earn his bachelors degree in less than two years, thanks to AMUDs eight-week course
options. He would take up to four courses at once, completing his bachelor(s in 2004. At the time, he was serving in the United States Air Force Space Command. He thought he might pursue
a career as a police officer or with the U.S. Marshals Service after the military. deCormier had joined the U.S. Air Force after serving in the U.S. Marines for nine years C1 an unusual move for
service members to change branches. Early during his Air Force career, he worked as a C-130 aircraft crew chief. However, he soon became very sick and learned he was allergic to hydraulic
fluid. deCormier was then assigned gate secutity duties Ol third shift -- at the Little Rock Air Force Base. It was just me in a shack with a light, he says. He was able to do much of his reading
for his bachelors degree on duty, completing and uploading assignments when home. deCormier separated from the Air Force after serving four years. He then earned a position controlling
satellites as a flight operations specialist, thanks to his Air Force experience and bachelor's degree. De Cormier knew further education was necessary for him to advance on his new career
