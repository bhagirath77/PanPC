[] edit Acquisitions In the early 1970s, Volvo acquired the passenger car division of the Dutch company , and marketed their small cars as Volvos before releasing the Dutch-built , which
went on to be one of the biggest-selling cars in the market in the 1980s. DAF Volvo 340 UK Volvo Group, as one of the largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles in the world, took the
initiative to sell its automobile manufacturing in 1998 in order to fully focus its efforts on the market for commercial vehicles. Ford, on the other hand, saw advantages in acquiring a
profitable prestige mid-size European automobile manufacturer, well renowned for its safety aspects, as an addition to its Premier Automotive Group. The buyout of Volvo Cars was
announced on , , and in the following year the acquisition was completed at a price of $6.45 billion . January 28 1998 USD As a result of the , the Volvo is now utilized by two separate
companies: divestiture trademark - a manufacturer of commercial vehicles, etc. owned by Swedish interests. Volvo Group Volvo Cars - a manufacturer of automobiles owned by , in its
(PAG). Ford Motor Company Premier Automotive Group [] edit Corporate history within Ford Volvo Car Corporation is part of Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group (). It is the
only brand left in the group since the sale of , and . Since its acquisition into the PAG, the company has grown in its range of vehicles. After the sale of JLR to Tata of India, Ford decided to
keep Volvo Cars despite mounting losses and gross economic down turns. Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars, pushing it further upmarket alongside the lower end of
Mercedes and BMW sedans, wagons, and SUV crossovers. This turnaround was quite evident with the luxurious second generation Volvo S80 and the new small premium crossover Volvo
XC60. Recently, there were talks about what to do with Volvo Cars in the event of a market failure with US automakers that would include parent FOMOCO. Swedish interest mounted their
concerns after repeated mass layoffs at Volvo, expressing that Sweden needs to enter the spotlight to help its automotive industry. The government was asked to look into a possible state
ownership of Volvo, or financing Volvo Cars and SAAB of GM. Eventually AB Volvo responded to heated talks and decided that they do not want to see Volvo Cars fail, so they agreed to
help Volvo cut costs through parternships and even a possible share ownership amongst a larger consortium. AB Volvo repeated and stood stern that they will not buy back Volvo cars nor
be sole majority owner. They are only willing to become part share owner of the once car unit. FOMOCO announced in December 2008 that it is now considering a sale of the Volvo Cars
unit through complex evaluations, but meanwhile it will try to make Volvo a more stand alone company. The Swedish government is now willing to help with a possible Swedish aquisiton
of Volvo Cars in the near future along with AB Volvo. No suitors have shown interest in a possible purchase as yet but it is believed that BMW AG of Germany, Investor AB of Sweden,
Chinese investors, or Russian investors are all possible candidates. Ultimately it will not be a price issue for the new owner but rather whom Volvo Cars prefer to take over, AB Volvo
decides to release name trademark too, and Ford feels will have FOMOCO and Volvo's best interest. PAG Jaguar Aston Martin Land Rover VCNA management is often criticized for
canceling the Free Maintenance program it used to offer on it's new Automobiles back in 2006, Volvo relaunched the same program in 2009 to gain some market share and compete with
BMW. The sales loss from 2006 to 2009 due to the previous cancellation is estimated to be 5000 new cars per year. [] edit Concept Plug-in Hybrid [] edit Sponsorship Volvo entered the
