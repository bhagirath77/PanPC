excellent address for world and business travellers to make you feel at home. Royal Plaza on Scotts The concept at Carousel dining place is excellent. It brings the flair of Paris into the heart of
the hotel with Asian and Mediterranean food to whet your appetite. I love the vogue colour of Carousel and cullery brings simple dining into faboulous. Heat Louge is a great place to hang out
