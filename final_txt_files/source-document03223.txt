3/8 yard cotton print fabric 3/8 yard coordinating cotton print fabric 1 cup dry regular rice (for filling the eye pillow) 3/8 cup dried lavender (for filling the eye pillow) Microbeads filler (for
filling the larger pillow) Funnel (for filling both pillows) Measuring cups For larger pillow: Cut out the front and back pieces: Two 16" x 11". For samller eye pillow: Cut out front and back
pieces: Two 9" x 4". SEWING For each pillow: Pin front and back together, right sides facing. Stitch around each pillow, leave opening on side for filling. Trim corners. Turn each pillow right
side out. Use the funnel to fill pillows. Fill smaller eye pillow with 1 cup rice and 1/8 cup of lavender. Pin opening closed. Fill larger pillow with microbeads. This can be messy, so you might
want to do it outside. Put in as much as you like of the microbeads, and follow with 1/4 cup of lavender. Pin opening closed. Stitch openings on both pillows closed securely. You can chill these
pillows in the fridge for a cooling feel on your neck, shoulders, or forehead. Or, for the rice-filled eye pillow ONLY, place in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm. Put in for 30 seconds more if it
isn't warm enough. Works wonders for a headache! And makes you feel like a pampered princess! Especially if you use a natural silk fabric. To personalize as a gift, write the name of the
recipient on the pillow with fabric paint. Stack one pillow on top of the other, wrap a snazzy little ribbon around both of them...Sweet and chic!
