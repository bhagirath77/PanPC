is to bring flavors that consumers love without the carbs and sugar. They are available in a variety of flavors, including three that are caffeine-free. All of the XS Energy Drinks, except the
caffeine-free flavors, have approximately 83 milligrams of caffeine. This is the equivalent to a one ounce shot of espresso. In contrast, a tall cup of Starbucks coffee contains approximately

225 mg of caffeine. XS drinks contain slightly more caffeine than market leader . However, an average soft drink, like Coke, will contain approximately 44 mg of caffeine. The drinks contain
