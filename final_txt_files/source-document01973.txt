Dennis Holloway, An Architect in Northern New Mexico | | Solar Architecture Home VR Archaeology Although my professors were all modernists, for most of my professional career I have
marched to a different drum. Seeking a true American architecture--buildings that grow organically from this land--I have had the good fortune to meet many Native American genii who
showed me, with wit, that there is an idiom of architecture as different from the European as the European is different from the Asian, African or Australian. It is a language of architecture that
is conditioned by centuries of experiment and experience with the climate and minute environmental conditions of this continent. This Native idiom of architecture seems to me the only
appropriate way to speak of shelter on Turtle Island... Little Bighorn Indian Memorial Competition | Ronald Davis Residence | Strong-Dimond Residence Picuris Holistic Health | Jemez Tourism
