most often in the hot and dry days in arid regions like the desert. It is caused when an air layer situated on the ground warms and begins to rise in an updraft. The winds blowing in the
area cause this air mass rises to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Similarly, the use of gravity score becomes important. In order to achieve a good research in this area, we need to
learn new techniques and strategies for the survey sample: those with high external validity, internal validity and high reliability. Fortunately, these techniques are easy to learn and use.
The results of the use has changed our approach to reflect subsequent events. The design of these studies are described in detail in the third mall in the guidelines for the evaluation and

from a few meters to over 1,000 meters vary in diameter, and its track can be from a few hundred meters to more than 100 km. It may take a few minutes to an hour or more. Within the
column of air, there is a very powerful updraught causes the very low atmospheric pressure at the surface. Immediately outside the column are winds rotate (counterclockwise in the
northern hemisphere clockwise in the southern) at speeds that can exceed 90 meters per second (200 miles per hour). / SPAN &gt; local alerts and to maintain follow the terms of the

from 100 metres to a kilometre wide and are rarely more than 15 miles in length. They can last from a few seconds to more than one hour, however, not exceed more than 10 minutes.
Most tornadoes travel from southwest to Northeast with an average speed of 30 km per hour, but the speed was observed that they vary from almost no movement at 70 mph. When and
