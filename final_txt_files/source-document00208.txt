Ginas Hogan Posted by Michael, May 11th , 2007. Recently we gave Ginas cob hogan a new layer of plaster. We started off by poking at the existing earthen plaster; raking off the loose stuff.
It was worn out, but what do you expect after 15 years? All around the base of the walls the earthen plaster had touched the ground. Moisture worked its way in. We had to remove about 3
inches in and 1 to 2 feet up in some spots. The wall undemeath was still in good shape. We filled in with a stiffer cob mix, rich with sand. We under cut the new cob, rather than plopping it on
the ground again. Continue... Adobe Healing Posted by Michael, May 2nd, 2007. This adobe wall suffered a water leak. I inspected the adobe bricks beneath and filled with an earthen plaster.
Local materials were sourced for the plaster. Some of the mud came from a near by ditch and some came from the wall itself. In the end the 10 foot walls received a lot of mud! Kelly, the
owner, sculpted a very nice relief on the finish plaster.
