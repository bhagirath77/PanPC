The question can not exceed 10,000 characters Answers(2) Sort by Best Answer - Chosen by Voting Here are my translations for you. Please consider that there could be a little bit of
variation from others! suggestions. 1. an-nyung-ha-se-yo(hi). jeo-ui ee-rum-eun Kara ip-ni-da.("My name is Kara.") yul-il-kop-sal ip-ni-da.( "I'm 17 years old) they are formal expression. you
don't want to be rude when you introduce yourself. agree with me?  2.What is your name? - - (dang-shin-ui ee-rum-ee mu-ut-ip-ni-kka?) this sounds a bit outdated, but I am giving this
because a casual one might be hard for you to pronounce. 3. Take Care! - - informal expressions: you can just say "an-nyung(bye)" or "jal-ga(go well)" for good-bye. the direct translation
might be "jal-ji-nae(be well)" with dropping intonation at the end. You could use this expression, but it is more often used for "how are you?" with elevating intonation. Personally, I usually say
"jal-ga" for good-bye or take-care. 4 & 6. From the Westem(English) influence, some people use the direct translational expression of "Good Morning" as "jo-eun ah-chim", but we don't
originally have the same expression. we just say "an-nyung" for Good moming and after as an informal...This case, you must have an elevating intonation because it could mean the good-bye
with dropping and dragging intonation at the end as mentioned in #3. 5. Good night. - -"jal-ja" as an informal meaning the good sleep. hope it help you. enjoy learning Korean, Kara. ~
