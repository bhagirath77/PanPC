TV Confidential "Super School News" is a mini television series written and illustrated by fifth and sixth grade students and presented on Rocky Mountain PBS. Each participating school's
two-minute "Super School News" segment runs five or six times in its assigned week in the following time slots: 10:25 a.m. 10:55 a.m. 2:25 p.m. (Sundays only, 2:55 p.m.) 4:55 p.m,
(Saturdays only, 5:25 p.m.) Each school involved selects two students to represent their school as student newscasters and up to four students as student reporters. Newscasters and reporters
from each school present a two-minute televised news program about their school. This program is aired five to six times during an assigned one-week period. The student newscasters and
reporters, along with a faculty advisor from their school, write a script about their school and design visual material to accompany the script. A production team (volunteers) from Rocky
Mountain PBS meets with the student newscasters at their school two weeks prior to taping to review and rehearse the script. The student newscasters and reporters then go to Rocky Mountain
PBS on a pre-assigned taping date to tape the final newscast. also funded by Super School News Watch Super School News More about 'Super School News For more information about
