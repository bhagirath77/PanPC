have appraised in Southeast Alaska and I am aware of the questions that underwriters typically have for this market - is a view really worth that much:
some of the many others.

  

? is it really in an avalanche area? and

delivery of the final product, I am able to eliminate the run around and phone tag hassles associated with this process. And since this process saves me money as well, I can keep my rates
