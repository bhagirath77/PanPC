Nuesse's website Reedereiflaggen: House Flags of Shipping Companies The shipping subsidiary of the giant national oil company PETROBRAS. Nuesse's site shows the green as a gray-green,
but I believe based on seeing Petrobras stations in Brazil that it is really the same as in the national flag. 16 June 2001 Joseph McMillan, FRONAPE's flag is not correct anymore. It was
changed since PETROBRAS changed its trademark (BR symbol) in 1994 and lately created its subsidiary for transportation in 1998, called TRANSPETRO. More information can be found at the
site below: (see Transpetro Trademark) , 7 January 2004 http://www.transpetro.com.br Carlos A. Mler image by , 20 February 2006 Jarig Bakker shows this flag with a green hexagon in the
fly. , 20 February 2006 Loughran (1979) Jarig Bakker .Source: Josef Nuesse's website Reedereiflaggen: House Flags of Shipping Companies Two related companies are Frota Amazenica S.A.
and Frota Ocednica Brasileira. Both fly flags divided vertically, with a large letter F mirroring itself in different colors. That for Amaz6nica has a green and yellow field with the Fs in white and
blue. The Nuesse site shows the Amazenica flag with a muddy greenish-grayish-blue hoist half. A check of the confirms that it should be green. 15 June 2001 company website Joseph

fly "F" as green rather than blue which may indicate original colours. 22 December 2002 Frota Oceica Brasileira S.A. Brown's Flags and Funnels 1982 1995 Neale Rosanoski, Frota Oceanica

15 June 2001 Joseph McMillan, Their fleet became absorbed into Frota Oceica e Amaznica in the 1990s. The flag in the picture above, by my calculations, is actually shown back to front even
though that is the way both Brown and display it. The company website image of the flags clearly shows that the white is in the hoist and if you study Josef's flag, although the hoist area does
not stand out, the width from the red "F" to the side is greater than that of the white "F" to the side indicating to me that the white includes the hoist area. 22 December 2002 1995 Josef
Nuesse Neale Rosanoski, image by , 12 November 2007 Anita I noticed the comment about the blue as the hoist [as opposed white in page]. Here is a picture of the logo I have on a piece of
china. Does the order of the color help date the flag? , 12 November 2007 Josef Nuesse Anita
