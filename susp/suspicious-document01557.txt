In 2000, the European PVC industry has launched a ten-year plan to improve the sustainability of its products and production during the entire life cycle. This means constantly improving
products and production processes, by investing in technology to reduce emissions and waste, and to increase the collection and recycling. The program is based on the "voluntary" signed
by Vinyl 2010. After the publication, the commitment received a series of comments consultations public and political, including the Directorate General environment of the European
Commission Enterprise Directorate-General. This led, in 2001, a document, revised and expanded. four member associations, key commitments include: compliance with the standard
PVC ECVM Charter of production. A plan for the complete replacement of the stabilizers to the lead by 2015, in addition to the replacement of cadmium stabilizers was achieved in March
2001. The recycling at the end of the year 2010 of 200,000 tons / year of PVC post-consumer waste 50% of the waste collection of PVC available for Windows, pipes, fittings and roofing in
2005 profiles, and a ground in 2008. Little expansion or contraction of the element resistance of glass fibers (see above) a maximum level of protection. Dimensional stability: meetings of

the great height of glass fibers, different types of Windows, which can be painted and install power supply designs, design flexibility Infinite. The Food and Drug Administration, found that
most patients have minimal risk of exposure to DEHP and added that "the risk of not doing a procedure required is much higher than the risks associated with DEHP exposure. The
European Commission's Scientific Committee for medicinal products and medical devices, said that there have been reports of adverse reactions in humans after exposure to DEHP-PVC
and concluded that currently there are no specific recommendations can be made for restricting the use of DEHP in a specific group of patients. (October 2002) plasticizers are used in
products such as. pipes, rigid vinyl cladding and rigid packaging. How secure is the abolition of the vinyl? Vinyl products yes most lasts a long time, but when they reach the end of their
useful life, can be administered like other consumer products, for disposal or recycling. For long products (conservation) in which wires, walls, Windows, floors and others may not be
available for recovery or disposal. But recycling millions of pounds of waste material vinyl each year, according to a report by the Vinyl Institute. In addition, some companies are

countless lives, medical tubing and blood bags and other patient care products that use PVC products Entitled, "the truth behind the PVC" leaflet and half-page chapter,. They're less than
1% of landfill have found in production of unnecessary additives, PVC products in soft PVC Leach from landfills, trivial dioxin PVC products, PVC product energy efficiency, PVC. Also,
companies already 68 per cent deck of PVC recycling. Recycling Xccent note it repurposes more than 26 tonnes of PVC items such as road construction cones retired, who is retired and ".

position has been and continues to be a reuse where possible and where not recycle. "The National Recreation and Park Association is composed of 22,000 professional park planners and
U.S. citizens" to "advance parks, recreation and conservation efforts that enhance the environmental quality of life for all peoples. Vinyl Institute represents the leading manufacturers
involved in the production of PVC vinyl in the United States and promotes the value of PVC and vinyl products to society. Human fertility is not measuring the effect, the study can't draw
any conclusions at all from phthalic acid salts and fertility. Secondly, there is a different metabolism of rat and human systems in humans, you can see that effect in rats, may not
appear. It's a fact that the studies on rats " advances in biomedical research, Narrow, however, there are several steps between animal models and clinical trials. We need to be careful
of discount, what real impact is applied directly to humans. It is unfortunate, the media lifted and describe the author unsubstantiated. In Europe, the 1990 and 1995, the average annual

health and environmental concerns of PVC, it is important to investigate alternative materials for medical purposes. "In fact, a growing number of hospitals and medical equipment
suppliers is gradually PVC products and replacing them with safer alternatives. Recent examples include Baxter International, Inc., The nation's leading manufacturer of IV bags, Universal
Health Services, Inc.., Management company the third largest hospital in the country, and Kaiser Permanente, the largest non-profit health maintenance organization in America. In
addition to revealing the sensitivity of patient exposure to DEHP, the coalition noted that the vinyl IV bags have a high content of chlorine. Therefore, the manufacture of vinyl and
disposal by incineration creates dioxin - one of the most toxic chemicals in the world. Also found the use of plastic, we have developed a number of ways to generate this industry, rather

the third part of the first part of the production of PVC is actually quite harmful to the environment and our health. Dioxins, highly toxic chemicals created during the process Its
production, was also released into the atmosphere on burning. Dioxins break down slowly in the environment, as either carcinogens reasonable person. Harmful additives are also used
vinyl, such as heavy metals, which act as stabilizers or give it color; fungicides. Less than 1% of PVC is recycled because it is not technically feasible or economically. A national coalition
of more than 60 environmental and health organizations call on the goal to phase out PVC in products and packaging. Since October, more than 40,000 customers Target signed petitions
and sent letters to the company and more than 200 events were held at the destination stores throughout the country. Nineteen countries have laws banning the sale or distribution of
packages containing intentionally added hexavalent chromium, lead, mercury and cadmium. States with these laws are California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland,
Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Iceland, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. (CHEJ) is working to prevent damage to
the mobile makers to manufacture, use and disposal of PVC in consumer products and packaging. CHEJ has worked with and convinced Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Wal-Mart,

have a specific gravity of commitment to European industry of PVC-a series of objectives, projects, initiatives and studies, mainly for environmental protection and resource management.
My knowledge of the program is unique in Europe or elsewhere. I think there is a lot of interest in this site and maybe a few surprises. If you have any questions or comments, don't
hesitate to let us know. Sincerely, Jean-Pierre De Greve, Secretary. Among the most important by-products of the life cycle of PVC are dioxin, EDC (ethylene dichloride) and VCM (vinyl
chloride monomer). The formation of dioxin a rotting organic compounds is one of the most potent carcinogens known to science (there's no safe dose) and one in which it is exposed
every American is a direct consequence of the chlorine content of s vinyl. Depending on your goals for the traffic, you can budget $100 or $100 of 000 PPCSEs you also take advantage,
you quickly can your conversion rates (leads, sales, and memberships) and rotate keywords (visitors) and test your Web site and easily. So in the short term strategy pay per click gives
you the distinct advantage over SEO. But the downside is the cost. According to the demand in the market for your keywords and clicks of your PPCSE campaign can generate tons of
traffic and can cost hundreds or even thousands per day. We recommend the combination of short-term benefits of a PPC campaign and long-term benefits of SEO for a return on
investment over a larger But if there is a fire in a building larger, PVC products will burn and release toxic substances like other organic products. The most important toxic substance is
released during fire carbon monoxide (CO), which is responsible for 90 to 95% of fire deaths. CO is a cunning murderer, because we can not smell it and most people die in fires while
sleeping.
