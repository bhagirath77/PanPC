Employee Performance Multi-Phase Appraisal Process Best practices in Performance Management dictate a proactive approach to the Performance Appraisal or Review Process that follows the
multi-phase design: Set mutually agreed upon goals and guidelines for employee evaluation. Determine the key objectives for measuring success in the position and set developmental goals to
encourage greater productivity and results.Planning Phase: The longest phase that allows the employee to meet goal and objectives, develop new skills and track accomplishments or set backs
in the system throughout the process. Managers are reviewing performance and making notes as well.Performance Phase: Employees are given an opportunity near the end of the performance
cycle to provide feedback on the preset goals, competencies and objectives to deliver to their manager. This is when the manager will document feedback on the employee performance as well
The system allows senior managers to review all submitted documentation and sign off before the actual review is complete.Assessment Phase: Manager and employee sit down together to
discuss the year in review. Reviews can be presented online or printed and e-signature that the review took place can be captured in the system to protect the organization if legal review
should occurReview Phase:Human Resource Management No Iframes Copyright 2008 . All Rights Reserved. HRsmart application tracking human resource software HRsmart provides the
