should be exercised as when you were the buyer. Preparation and attention to detail often sets a home apart from the rest, meaning both the seller and the buyer come out as the winners. A

help to move the home faster and at a higher selling price. Chances are good that many of the defects will be reported when the buyer commissions an inspection, at which time it can become
