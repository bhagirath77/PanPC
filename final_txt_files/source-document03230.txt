dNeero Social Surveys Sunday, February 24th, 2008 | with Online Survey Reviews No Comments  Here's a new survey site I found recently thats great for all you out there with MySpace,
Facebook or similar accounts. The site is called dNeero and they feature social surveys. Now what is a social survey you might ask (I know I did). They are surveys that let you post your
answers to your blog or social network profile so other can react and interact with them. Now I haven't been really active with social networks, but I do have a and I think this is a cool idea.
And the coolest part is they pay you to take the surveys and pay you more when others respond to the surveys you post to your social profiles. Current surveys listed pay anywhere from $0.75
to $11.00 which isnt bad considering the surveys take just a few minutes to take. Hi5 profile The site went into public beta on June 2Sth 2007 so its still a fairly new site, but it looks to be
growing pretty well with over 29,000 surveys taken as of today. And the dNeero surveys have been shown over 3.3 million times. That's a lot of survey views. My first survey is below, simply
click the banner to see the questions and my answers and to take the survey yourself to get started with dNeero. Oh and have fun with it! Popularity: 43%[] ? Yale School of Management
eLab - Center for Customer Insights Thursday, February 14th, 2008 | with Online Survey Reviews No Comments  The Yale School of Management eLab was created to host academic studies
that research consumer behavior. They do this through the use of online surveys that helps researchers lear more about human behavior, especially as it relates to their internet usage. The
Yale School of Management eLab is part of The Yale Center for Customer Insights. Once you register you will receive invitations from the Yale eLab to participate in their online surveys and
studies. Each survey you complete gives you the opportunity to win either cash or Amazon gift certificates with values ranging from $20-$100. Each study you complete increases your chances
of winning cash or prizes! You can sign up for the Yale School of Management eLab here I've found that it is very easy to be chosen for awards from The Yale School of Management eLab and
The Yale Center for Customer Insights. The reason for this is that the surveys are limited to a certain number of people. In some cases your odds of being chosen are as good as 50-1. This is a
huge improvement over the large internet survey companies where you may be one in tens of thousands taking a survey or screener. The Yale Center for Customer Insights, through the Yale
School of Management eLab is able to test marketing and customer satisfaction theories quickly and effectively. They provide insight and understanding into customer behavior that can be used
to improve business and society. Because of the Yale school of Managements relationship with its corporate affiliates your opinions can easily influence decisions made at such companies as
PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Samsung. I hope you enjoyed this Yale eLab review. Popularity: 33%[] ? Yahoo User Research Review Thursday, February 14th, 2008 |
