Oct 7, 2008 9:53 PM Lynn World Class Blogger! Oct 8, 2008 10:32 AM beckster in response to: Lynn Cant wait till next week! Question. Lots of games you have seen or been part of in some
way. Of the ones you didn't get to see live what event do you most wish to have been there to catch? Oct 8, 2008 1:00 PM Big Galloot in response to: beckster Looking forward to hearing
more Bill. Since you've been involved (and revolutionized the way we watch sports) for over 50 years, whats your most memorable games, season, interviews, etc.? Also, since you brought up
the BCS, will we ever see a national champ via a playoff in our lifetime? Finally, Vandy's off to a great start, but I like the Cubs chances of winning the world series before Vandy is crowned
national champ. Oct 8, 2008 6:43 PM Jasamozh Okay Bill, I know I am going to sound like someone from a different planet (to other bloggers anyway, I doubt that you will be surprised) but
here goes. I am a greenhorn when it comes to certain sports and as dumb as a doomail at understanding anything about it unless it's written down on paper. For people like us, it will be nice to
see a section with a step by step tutorial on sports like Football (Rugby to me), Lacrosse (which is totally new to me) and baseball. Although I am not totally hopeless (I can understand other
sports), I just cannot get these three. Help!!! Oct 9, 2008 2:59 PM shawn looking forward to hearing more! Oct 10, 2008 1:57 PM jhdi6 Where's your favorite place to watch a college
football game? Are there any special places we should visit this fall, for a great campus experience? Oct 13, 2008 3:06 PM Ricky Bobby Bill, If you went on a speaking tour talking to high
school athletes/students and could take one college athlete and one coach with you, who would you take? The topic would be sportmanship, honor, and the spirit of college sports. Dec 27,
2008 1:30 PM trackie29 I'm a huge fan of college sports and looking to work in sports administration.
