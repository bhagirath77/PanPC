Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in U.S. women, excluding skin cancer. If the current rate stays the same, women born today have about a 1 in 8 chance of developing
breast cancer at some point during their lives. Although mortality rates have steadily decreased since 1990, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. women,
exceeded only by lung cancer. Breast Cancer Facts and Stats Key Statistics: In 2007, an estimated 178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women living in the
U.S. In addition, approximately 62,030 new cases of in situ breast cancer will be diagnosed. An estimated 40,460 women in the U.S. will die from the disease. The chance of getting
breast cancer increases with age. During 2000-2004, 95% of new cases occurred in women aged 40 years and older. Although incidence is highest for Caucasian women, African American
women have the highest mortality rate, followed by Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Asian American/Pacific Island women. Between 1990 and 2004, U.S.
deaths due to breast cancer decreased 2.2% annually. The decline has been largely attributed to earlier detection and improved treatments. When detected early, the 5-year relative survival
rate for localized breast cancer is roughly 98%. For regional disease, the rate is 84%, If the cancer has spread to distant organs, 5-year survival drops to 27%. Larger tumor size at diagnosis is,
also associated with decreased survival. Risk Factors: Female gender is the most important risk factor for breast cancer. The risk for females is 100 times that of males. Currently, a woman
living in the U.S. has a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing the disease. After gender, age is the most important risk factor. The older a woman, the greater her chances of developing the
disease. Additional factors associated with risk are family history and genetics, previous breast pathology, previous radiation to the chest, hormonal factors, breast density and certain
behavioral factors such as alcohol consumption, and possibly, diet and smoking. Environmental factors may also play a role. Most women, however, who develop breast cancer have no known
risk factors other than gender and age. Risk Reduction: For women at average risk, the emphasis is on regular screening and healthy lifestyle habits. Women at increased risk should
consider additional risk reduction strategies in consultation with their healthcare providers. For asymptomatic women 40 years and older, the American Cancer Society recommends an annual
mammogram and clinical breast examination. Women under 40 should receive a clinical breast examination at least every three years. Monthly breast self-examinations are considered
optional.Early detection is the key to saving lives. References: American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2007. Retrieved Nov. 21, 2007 from American Cancer Society web site at:
