autoantibody-associatedcongenital heart block.Objective: Dynamic, longitudinal cohort study.Design: 55 children with isolated congenital heart block,their 52 mothers, and 5 other women
currently carrying fetuseswith congenital heart block. All matemal sera contained antibodiesto SSA/Ro alone or to both SSA/Ro and SSB/La.Patients: Clinical information obtained from mailed
questionnaires,telephone interviews, primary physicians, and chart reviews.Measurements: When congenital heart block was identified in thechildren, 23 women were asymptomatic, 15 had
systemic lupuserythematosus, 8 had the Sjogren syndrome, and 11 had an undifferentiatedautoimmune syndrome. Follow-up ranged from 1 week to 20 years(median, 3.7 years). Eleven
(48%) of the 23 initially asymptomaticmothers developed symptoms of a rheumatic disease (0.15 statuschanges/patient-year of follow-up; 6 [26%] developed an undifferentiatedautoimmune
syndrome, 2 (9%) developed the Sjogren syndrome,and 3 (13%) developed systemic lupus erythematosus. One motherwith the Sjogren syndrome progressed to systemic lupus
erythematosus.Four (16%) of 25 subsequent pregnancies in 22 women were complicatedby heart block. Seventeen affected children died, 12 within1 month of birth. Pacemakers were
implanted in 37 (679%) of theSS children, 27 within 3 months after birth.Results: The development of rheumatic disease in asymptomaticmothers identified by the birth of a child with
congenital heartblock is common but not universal. The risk for congenital heartblock in subsequent pregnancies is low. One third of the childrenwith autoantibody-associated congenital heart
block die in theearly neonatal period and, of those who survive, most requirepacemakers.Conclusion: Author and Article Information From the Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York University
