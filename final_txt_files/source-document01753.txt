move. Joints consist of the following: cartilage-at the joint, the bones are covered with cartilage (a connective tissue), which is made up of cells and fibers and is wear-resistant. Cartilage helps
reduce the friction of movement. synovial membrane-a tissue called the synovial membrane lines the joint and seals it into a joint capsule. The synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid (2
clear, sticky fluid) around the joint to lubricate it. ligaments-strong ligaments (tough, elastic bands of connective tissue) surround the joint to give support and limit the joint's movement.
tendons-tendons (another type of tough connective tissue) on each side of a joint attach to muscles that control movement of the joint. bursas-fluid-filled sacs, called bursas, between bones,
ligaments, or other adjacent structures help cushion the friction in a joint. synovial fluid-a clear, sticky fluid secreted by the synovial membrane. femur-the thigh bone.
