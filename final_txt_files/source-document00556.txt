Starbucks raises prices of most coffee drinks by five cents Updated 9/22/2006 10:05 AM ET | | | E-mail Save Print By Allison Linn, Associated Press SEATTLE (I Starbucks said Thursday that
it plans to raise prices of its lattes, cappuccinos, drip coffee and other drinks 5 cents, or an average 1.9%. (SBUX) The increase, effective Oct. 3 at all company-operated stores in the USA and
Canada, marks the first time the company has boosted drink prices in two years. Starbucks also is increasing the price of its coffee beans by about 50 cents a pound, or an average of 3.9%.
That's the first price increase for whole beans in nine years, spokeswoman Valerie O'Neil said. : WHY YOU SHOULD CARE Starbucks is a benchmark Starbucks isn't raising prices on the
prepared drinks it sells in refrigerated cases. O'Neil said the company decided to charge more because costs, including fuel and energy, are going up. "It's not one specific thing. It's part of
our ongoing evaluation of business costs," O'Neil said. Starbucks' prices vary based on the market, but the 5-cent price increase will be across the board, regardless of the drink or the part of
the country, O'Neil said. Currently, a tall, or 12-ounce, cup of Starbucks coffee costs $1.40 to $1.65. Twelve-ounce lattes cost $2.40 to $3.10, depending on the market, and a tall mocha costs
$2.70 to $3.40. Seattle-based Starbucks had 8,624 stores in the United States as of Aug. 30; about 5,500 are company-operated. O'Neil says Starbucks has 495 company-operated stores in
Canada. She did not have a figure for the total number of stores there. Copyright 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or
