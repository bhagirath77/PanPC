Groups > Region Region Pages Wine regions are as varied as the wines that come from them. In many, but not all cases, the wines tend to speak about their origins; this is what the French
term terroir means; regional or even vineyard specific attributes that are apparent in the finished wines. Some of the most famed terroir in the world come from regions with distinctive climate
and soil combination such as the mountainous Mosel region of Germany or the basalt rich soils one find in the Basilicata region of Italy and of course the limestone rich soils of Chablis. Each
one of these regions imparts a unique set of recognizable attributes to their wines, but not every region is so blessed. Regions can be large, varied area, such as Tuscany or Piemonte in Italy.
They can be large and more uniform like Bordeaux and Burgundy in France. They can even be large and full of many smaller regions, such as CaliforniaCls Napa Valley and the 14 AVAs
(America Viticultural Areas) that fall within the Napa Valley Confines. Regions can be have their boundaries set due to historical or political considerations, such as is the case with Chianti
Classico in Tuscany or Rioja in Spain. They can be based on geographical factors such as is the case with the Chiles Valley AVA set within Napa Valley or ArgentinaC)s Uco Valley. Regions can
even be based on a specific estate or winery such is the case with the estate of Chateau Grillet in FranceCls Rhone Valley or CaliforniaCls Guenoc Valley. The only things all wine regions share
is that they are recognized as the delimited region for a specific wine which is noted on the label and that they will eventually have their own group page on Snooth. Popular Region Pages
