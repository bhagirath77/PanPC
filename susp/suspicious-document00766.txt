Experimental), a replacement for the with greater range and payload. A particular emphasis was placed on accurate delivery of weapons to reduce the cost per target. The requirements
were finalized in 1963 and in 1964, the Navy announced the (Heavier-than-air, Attack, Light) competition. Contrary to USAF philosophy, which was to employ only supersonic fighter
bombers such as the and , the Navy felt that a subsonic design could carry the most payload the farthest distance. Theoretically, a "slow fat duck" could fly nearly as fast as a supersonic
one, since carrying dozens of iron bombs also restricted its entry speed, but a fast aircraft with small wings and an afterburner would burn more fuel. United States Navy VAX A-4

fighter, the A-7 had a shorter, broader fuselage. The wing was made larger, and the unique variable incidence wing of the F-8 was deleted. To achieve the required range, the A-7 was
powered by a -P-6 producing 11,345 Ibf (50.5 kN) of thrust, the same innovative combat turbofan produced for the and early , but without the afterburner needed for supersonic speeds

followed by the , which was integrated into the ILAAS digital navigation system. The radar also fed a digital weapons computer which made possible accurate delivery of bombs from a
greater stand-off distance, greatly improving survivability compared with faster platforms such as the . It was the first U.S. aircraft to have a modern head-up display, now a standard
instrument, which displayed information such as dive angle, airspeed, altitude, drift and aiming reticle. The integrated navigation system allowed for another innovation the projected map
display system (PMDS) which accurately showed aircraft position on two different map scales. AN/APQ-116 AN/APQ-126 F-4 Phantom II The A-7 enjoyed the fastest and most trouble free

the USAF announced that it would purchase a version of the A-7, designated the , for . The Air Force ordered the A-7D with a fixed high speed refueling receptacle behind the pilot
optimized for the 's flying boom rather than the folding long of the Navy aircraft. The most important difference from the preceding Navy versions was the adoption of the turbofan, a
license-built version of British Rolls-Royce Spey. With 14,500 Ibf (64.5 kN) of thrust, the engine offered a considerable boost in performance. The cannon was selected in place of the twin
single-barrel 20 mm cannon. In addition, avionics were upgraded. The prototype with TF30 flew on , with the first TF41 aircraft taking to the air on . The aircraft were later updated to
carry the laser spot tracker to add the capability to drop guided bombs. A total of 459 were built and assigned to tactical fighter wings of the (TAC). Robert McNamara A-1 Skyraider 5

impressed with the performance gain of USAF A-7D that they ordered their own version with the TF41 engine and M61 cannon, the , to go along with the new continuous solution weapon
systems and sophisticated avionics that was developed in the A-7C model that was highly advanced for that era. The first prototype flew on . A-7Es were turned out in 1970s with
outstanding mission success in the fleet. In 1979 the first around-the-clock night-attack FLIR-capable aircraft were delivered to VA-81 at , Florida. During the 1980s, when defense budgets
finally allowed, funding for upgrades various system upgrades and engineering change proposal mods were incorporated to increase reliability, safety and mission effectiveness. In 1986,
231 A-7Es were equipped to carry the (Low-Altitude Night Attack) pod which projected amplified light image on the HUD and, in conjunction with radar, provided terrain following down to
460 mph (740 km/h) at 200 ft (60 m). A total of 529 examples were built (not counting 67 A-7Cs).A-7E 25 November 1968 NAS Cecil Field LANA YA-7F "Strikefighter" prototype in 1989 In
1985, the USAF requested proposals for a fast strike aircraft because of concerns that was too slow for interdiction. The design called for a new engine, either the -PW-220 or -GE 100. LTV
responded with the YA-7F, a supersonic version of A-7 powered by an F100-PW-220 with 26,000 Ibf (116 KN) thrust. To accommodate the new engine, the fuselage was lengthened about 4
ft (1.22 m). New fuselage sections were inserted in both the forward and aft fuselage - a 30 in (76 cm) section in front of the wing and an 18 in (46 cm) section behind the wing. The wing
was strengthened and fitted with new augmented flaps, leading edge extensions and automatic maneuvering flaps. The vertical stabilizer height was increased about 10 in (25 cm)the unit
horizontal tail was flipped from dihedral to anhedral, and control surfaces were flattened. Unsurprisingly, the end result resembled the supersonic F-8 Crusader from which the original
subsonic A-7 was derived. A-10 Thunderbolt I Pratt & Whitney F100 General Electric F110 The new supersonic A-7 could accelerate with a 17,380 Ib (7,880 kg) bomb load from 400 to
550 knots (1,020 km/h) in under 15 seconds and could sustain Mach 1.6 for longer times with the extra fuel. The YA-7F modifications allowed 7-g turn and burn capability that permitted
high-speed sustained evasive maneuvers plus great improvements in high angle of attack performance. As a CAS/BAI platform to penetrate into enemy territory and return safely, the
"strikefighter" moniker was most fitting. Two A-7Ds were extensively modified, the first one flying on and breaking the on its second flight. The second prototype flew on . The project was
canceled due to improved relations with former adversaries, lower defense budgets, and the , by then the principal USAF operator of the A-7 generally favoring the in-production . 29

units. This was in keeping with the role of these bases in already hosting the attack squadrons that would eventually transition to the A-7. From 1967 - 1971 a total of 27 Navy squadrons
took delivery of four different A-7A/B/C/E models. The Vought plant in Dallas, TX employed up to 35,000 workers turned out one aircraft a day for several years to support the Navy
carrier-based needs for Vietnam and SE Asia and commitments to NATO in Europe. In 1974, when the (CV 41) became the first Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) aircraft carrier to be
homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, two A-7A squadrons assigned to Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5) were concurrently homeported at , Japan. In 1978, these squadrons (VA-93 and VA-56)
finally transitioned to the much more advanced A-7E model. Six Naval Reserve squadrons would also eventually transition to the A-7, operating from , Florida; NAS Atlanta/, Georgia; ,
Louisiana; , California and , California. An additional active duty squadron stood up in the 1980s, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at would also operate twin-seat TA-7C

Thailand Pilots of the early A-7s lauded the aircraft for general ease of flying (with the exceptions of poor stability on cross-wind landings and miserable stopping performance on wet
runways with an inoperative anti-skid braking system) and excellent forward visibility but noted a lack of engine thrust. This was addressed with A-78 and more thoroughly with A-7D/E.
The turbofan engine provided a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency compared with earlier the A-7D was said to have one sixth that of an at equivalent thrust. An A-7D carrying 12 x 500 Ib
(227 kg) bombs at 480 mph (775 km/h) at 33,000 ft (10,000 m) used only 3,350 Ib (1,500 kg) of fuel per hour. Typical fuel consumption at mission retrograde during aircraft carrier
recovery was approximately 30 pounds per minute compared to 100+ pounds per minute for the Phantom F-43/N series. The A-7 Corsair II was tagged with the nickname "SLUF" ("hort
ittle gly ucker") by pilots. turbojets specific fuel consumption F-100 Super Sabre [1] SLUF The integrated weapons computer provided highly accurate bombing with of 60 ft (20 m)
regardless of pilot experience. When Vought technical representatives were available to "tweak" the inertial systems, the CEP was often less than five meters for experienced fleet
aviators. The inertial navigation system required a mere 2.5 minutes on the ground for partial (coarse) alignment, a big improvement over 13 minutes required in . For newly
manufactured E models, the A-7 required only 11.5 of maintenance per mission resulting in quick turnaround and high number of combat-ready aircraft. However, after several years of
exposure to the harsh marine conditions aboard aircraft carriers, the maintenance hours per sortie were often twice this amount. CEP F-4 Phantom II man hours For its day, the SLUF
offered a plethora of leading edge avionics. This included data link capabilities that, among other features, provided fully "hands-off" carrier landing capability when used in conjunction
with its approach power compensator (APC) or auto throttle. Other notable and highly advanced equipment was a projected map display located just below the radar scope. The map
display was slaved to the inertial navigation system and provided a high-resolution map image of the aircraft's position superimposed over TPC/JNC charts. Moreover, when slaved to the
all-axis auto pilot, the inertial navigation system could fly the aircraft "hands off" to up to nine individual way points. Typical inertial drift was minimal for newly manufactured models and
the inertial measurement system accepted fly over, radar, and TACAN updates. [2] Pilots quipped that the Corsair "is not very fast, but it sure is slow." For (DACT), and aerial
demonstrations by the , the Navy would choose the more nimble as a subsonic maneuvering platform, as some considered the A-7 to be inadequate in air combat, even though it was
highly maneuverable and was more fitting as a highly successful attack aircraft with a stable bombing platform. The Marine Corps would also pass on the Corsair, opting instead for the
vertical landing as their light attack aircraft to replace their A-4F/M Skyhawks. and units, however, were often forced to operate the A-7E and D models in rather challenging air-to-air
duels with USAF and USN . Several SLUF units adopted a technique pioneered by the : if an F-15 Eagle approaches gun range, depart the A-7 from controlled flight and deploy as much
chaff and flares as possible. Departing an A-7 from controlled flight resulted in very high and simultaneous roll, yaw and pitch rates. It also caused a near instantaneous airspeed loss of
100 to 150 knots (280 km/h) that made successful gun-tracking by an opponent nearly impossible. Deploying chaff and flares during such an event spewed these devices in all directions as
the range between the two aircraft rapidly diminished and consequently posed a chaff/flare collision threat to the attacking aircraft documented by Puerto Rican and units. [3] dissimilar air

citation needed A VA-147 A-7A from the (CVA 61) over Vietnam in 1968 USS Ranger In Vietnam, the hot, humid air robbed even the upgraded A-7D and A-7E of power. Takeoff rolls
were lengthy and fully-armed aircraft struggled to reach 800 km/h. For A-7A aircraft, high density altitude and maximum weight runway takeoffs often necessitated a "low transition,"
where the aircraft was intentionally held in "ground effect a few feet off the runway during gear retraction, and as much as a 10-mile (16 km) departure at treetop altitude before
reaching a safe flap retraction speed. (Note: the A-7A wing flap systems were either fully extended or fully retracted. The A-7A flap handle did not have the microswitch feature of later
models that permitted the flaps to be slowly raised by several degrees per tap of the flap handle as airspeed slowly increased during max-weight takeoffs.) [4] [5] Carrier catapult
launches at maximum weight under these performance-robbing conditions were not significantly better and were characterized by the aircraft decelerating by as much as 20 knots

(37 km/h) immediately after launch. As a result, A-7A units operated their aircraft 4 thousand pounds below the max-rated takeoff weight for the A-7E. [6] [7] The first U.S. Navy A-7As

helicopters but the aircraft's high endurance and durability were an asset and it performed admirably. On , Major Colin A. Clarke led a successful CSAR mission near to rescue a downed

found their duties complicated, due to the inherent changing of the weather conditions aboard a moving ship and the color coded uniforms of the flight deck crew; with the added dangers
involved to an already cluttered flight deck, it was determined to keep naval aircraft readily visible for the sake of safety. camouflage On , A-7E aircraft aboard the USS Coral Sea, in
