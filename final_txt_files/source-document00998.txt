Rincon de la Vieja National Park The volcanic Cordillera de Guanacaste includes the dramatically beautiful 14,083Ha national park, named after the active Rincon de la Vieja Volcano (1895m),
which is the main attraction, There are several other peaks in the same volcanic massif, of which the Santa Maria Volcano is the highest (1916m). There are numerous cones, craters and
lagoons in the summit area, which can be visited on horseback and foot. Major volcanic activity occurred in the late 1960s, currently the Rincon de la Vieja Volcano is gently active and does
not present any danger. There are fumaroles and boiling mud pool, steam vents and sulphurous springs to explore. Thirty-two rivers and streams have their sources within the park and thus it
is an important water catchments area. The park was first created in 1974. Forests protect the rivers from evaporation in the dry season and from flooding in the wet season. Elevations in the
park range from less than 600 meters to 1916 meters and the changes in altitude result in the presence of four life zones. Visitors pass through a variety of different habitats as the volcanoes
are ascended. The trail up to the crater of Von Seebach, with views over neighboring Rincon de la Vieja, is an arduous 8km, but leads through remarkable diverse landscapes, home of some
257 bird species as well as ocelots, jaguars, sloths and monkeys. Many species of trees are found in the forests. Plants include the country's highest density of Costa Rica's national flower.
