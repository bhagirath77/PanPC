December 23, 2008 Rick Warren takes another baby step Until yesterday, the Web site for the Rev. Rick Warren's Saddleback Church stated that "someone unwilling to repent for their
homosexual lifestyle would not be accepted as a member at Saddleback" (see screenshot below). Now that language is gone. Is Rick Warren finally getting it? Or is he just trying to be more

politically correct, as inauguration day nears?
