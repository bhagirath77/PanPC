[] edit Other elements Many elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the
characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function. One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low
concentrations and are pervasive, so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce. [1] Relatively large quantities of are required, but there is no RDA, as the
sulfur is obtained from and used for , and therefore should be adequate in any diet containing enough protein. sulfur [6] amino acids is required in the synthesis of , but because bacteria
are required to synthesize the , it is usually considered part of rather than its own mineral deficiency. Cobalt vitamin 812 vitamin vitamin B12 deficiency There have been occasional
studies asserting the essentiality of , but it currently has no known RDA. nickel [7] is sometimes described as essential. It is implicated in sugar metabolism in humans, leading to a
market for the supplement, , but definitive biochemical evidence for a physiological function is lacking. Chromium [8] [9] chromium picolinate [10] has been described as conditionally
essential, depending upon the importance placed upon the prevention of chronic disease. Fluoride [11] [12] ,,,,, , and have established, albeit specialized, biochemical roles as
structural or functional cofactors in other organisms. These elements appear not to be utilized by humans. Arsenic boron bromine cadmium silicon tungsten vanadium [] citation needed
