Your membership in the Scripps Oceanographic Society supports... Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the largest, oldest, and most important centers for global science research and
graduate student training in the world-and its interpretive center, The Birch Aquarium at Scripps, dedicated to promoting ocean science education, interpreting Scripps research, and promoting
ocean conservation. Your Membership Makes a Difference! The Birch Aquarium receives no direct state funding, and must generate more than $3 million each year in gifts, grants, and income
to operate its programs. Your membership provides vital support for the aquarium's exhibits and hands-on displays. Your support also helps the aquarium maintain successful breeding
programs (sea horses, corals, and more), which help reduce the need for collections in the wild. And SOS membership income provides crucial support for Scripps's outreach efforts, helping
the aquarium deliver exciting science programs directly into the schools and communities, and promoting awareness of ocean science research. Benefits Overview Explorations Magazine only
