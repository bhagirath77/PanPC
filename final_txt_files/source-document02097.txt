Save for later ? To be anatomically correct, when referring to the , one refers to the portion of the lower extremity that occupies the space between the and the . The leg consist of the tibia
and the fibula. The larger leg , the tibia, is located more medially and centrally than the fibula. Often commonly referred to as the shin bone, the tibia proximally meets the at the of the knee
while meets distally with the talus of the joint. The tibia and fibula also conjoin together with each other proximally and distally. The proximal end of the tibia has two mild depressions known as
the medial and lateral condyles. They are responsible for connecting with the condyles of the femur. The intercondylar eminence is an upward protrusion that crests in between the two condyles
and provides segregation as well as an anchor for the crutiate ligaments necessary for the motion. The patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. This can be found on the
proximoanterior portion of the tibia. The common body part known as the shin is actually the anterior crest. It is nothing more than a sharp and definite ridge along the surface of the bones
body. Along the distomedial end of the tibia there is a knobby protrusion that can be felt from the outside of the body. This knob is technically referred to as the medial malleolus. The fibular
notch is then located on the opposite side, the distolateral surface, and serves to conjoin with the fibula. The tibia is much larger and more dominant, and whether by design or designed to bear
weight, it takes over 75%of the body's weight bearing motions. The fibula is structurally designed for muscular attachment rather than weight bearing activities. The head of the fibula conjoins
with the tibia at the tibias proximolateral end. The lateral malleolus is defined and distinctive as a prominent knobby feature at the distal end of the fibula
