Green Building Greening the Home Hazardous Products / Health Issues The Great Green Outdoors Learn about efficient low-E coatings in of my series on windows; to compare windows using
the NFRC label; and for a look at traditional wood-framed windows. I'll now cover windows framed in vinyl. Vinyl, or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a long-lasting, low-maintenance option, however
one should be aware of the dark side of PVC. Part 1 Part II Part IIT The manufacturing of PVC is actually quite harmful to the environment and to our health. Dioxins, highly toxic chemicals,
are created during its manufacturing process and also released into the atmosphere upon burning. Dioxins break down very slowly in the environment and have been classified as probable
human carcinogens. Harmful additives are also used in vinyl, such as heavy metals which act as stabilizers or to give it color; and fungicides. Less than 1% of PVC is recycled because it is
neither technically nor financially feasible. Even when it is recycled, toxic additives must be used to restabalize it. So, even though vinyl-framed windows do not require painting and have good
moisture resistance, there may be more eco-friendly alternatives, such as sustainably-harvested wood. Stay tuned for the remaining blog posts about the characteristics of aluminum,
composite, and fiberglass window frames.
