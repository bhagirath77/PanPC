Billings and Collections Collection of Delinquent Taxes The Department of Billings and Collections plays a unique role in the collection of delinquent Real Estate, Personal Property, and Business
and Professional License taxes. These taxes provide a major source of revenue to the city of Roanoke for operation and administration of city government, payment of city debts, operation of
public schools, libraries, and other general municipal services. The City Treasurer is responsible for collection of these taxes during the year they are assessed. After the year of assessment,
the City Treasurer remains the banker for processing payments for these taxes, but the responsibility of collecting these taxes becomes that of Billings and Collections. Real Estate taxes are
collected on a fiscal year basis and become the responsibility of Billings and Collections on July 1 of the year following their assessment. Personal Property taxes and Business and Professional
License taxes are collected on a calendar year basis and become the responsibility of Billings and Collections on January 1 of the year following their assessment. The city of Roanoke
