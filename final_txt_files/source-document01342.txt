Eventually, with the construction of valve instruments, the interest for these great, natural main intervals faded, and the "new sound" composers of the 20th century turned to even finer
intervals of the major and minor second Ci that is, the space between the seventh and eighth overtone, the eighth and ninth overtone; or the space between the ninth and tenth overtone, and
the tenth and eleventh overtone respectively. Mechanistic Differentiation in the Musical Macrocosm. At this point, however, the new composers began to intimidate the music lover; for,
even to the uneducated ear, the discrepancy of the "forced marriage" between the microcosm and the macrocosm of music became clear; a marriage, in which the microcosm produces shrill
dissonances due to the lack of sensitivity of the macrocosm. The Forced Marriage of Macrocosm and Microcosm of Music The continuous playing of tones at too small intervals causes 2
friction between their high overtones, which are too closely spaced, and creates a strange sharpness of shrill dissonances, thus destroying the comprehension of the inner content of a
composition Cl since they shift the attention of the listener, and even that of the musician, incessantly from the immanent logic of the composition to the gross combat of overtones. Thus, each
overtone fights its neighbour for superiority, something we perceive as shrill, and reject as unpleasant. This leads us to twelve-tone music and to the technique of serial composition of the 20th

century Ol the so-called avantgarde. The Friction between High Overtones Not that the great classics had been unable to write in seconds or to produce dissonances, but in the
mixture of the outer-musical macrocosm and the inner-tonal microcosm they rather knew the natural limits, which exist as long as the musician does not master the microcosm of music. The
Twelve-Tone Music and the Serial Composing Technique Therefore, the great classical composers from Bach to Wagner only approached, but never crossed, the border to disharmony, and

thus created mostly harmonious music. This indicates that they were guided by their natural inner hearing, and that to them a lined sheet of paper was not a drawing board for the construction
of music. With perfect confidence the great classical musicians simply brought to paper what they heard within, The Tonal Orientation of the Great Composers in the Classical Era Beyond
