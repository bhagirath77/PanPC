Two Rivers Canoe Rental offers short and long float trips (see ). The short float is on the Caddo River, and the long float is on the Ouachita (except for the first 2 miles.) Custom float trips
on either river are available as well. For the beginner or a family outing, the long float on the Ouachita is a wonderful experience. The river's long, lazy pools and sparkling shoals make the river
especially inviting for families wishing to pause for a swim and/or picnic along the way. The long float begins on the Caddo River at the Two Rivers Canoe Rental put-in point and joins the
Ouachita River 2 miles later. It then continues on for 6 more miles and ends at the Ouachita River bridge park take-out point in Arkadelphia. The long float is an 8 mile float which takes
between 4 to 5 hours. What a great way to spend the day! On short floats the take out point is at the . For long floats, it's the at the Ouachita River Bridge Park. Being the end of the float, feel
free to use the available picnic and camping areas. Also, remember to enjoy the large gravel bars along the river for camping or picnicking.Canoeing on the Ouachita River
