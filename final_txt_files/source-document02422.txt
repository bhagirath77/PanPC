Las Vegas Broadway, as the name implies, is a large, wide avenue in New York City, New York, and is one of the oldest main north-south thoroughfares in the city, dating back to the first Dutch
New Amsterdam settlement. It runs the length of Manhattan, the central borough, being the only street running from almost the southern tip of the island, where it starts at Bowling Green, to
the northern tip. It then crosses the Harlem River as the Bridge and continues through the Bronx and into Westchester County. (There are also separate streets called "Broadway" in the city,
one each in the other three New York City Boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island; and smaller streets using its name such as East Broadway, West Broadway, Old Broadway, and
others in Manhattan itself.) Broadway Broadway Broadway continues running through several Hudson River towns of Westchester County, before becoming the "New York-Albany Post Road",
and running as far north as the state capital, Albany. Diagonally crossing the Commissioners Plan of 1811 of Manhattan streets, it has been marked by "squares" (some merely triangular
slivers of open space) and induced some interesting architecture, such as the famous Flatiron Building. The section of lower from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical
location for the city's ticker-tape parades, and is sometimes called the Canyon of Heroes in reference to such events.Broadway One famous stretch near Times Square in midtown Manhattan,
