Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Arts Degree Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree at Connecticut College include 128 semester hours of academic credit distributed among
general education, elective courses, and the academic major. A Connecticut College education is significantly broader than the accumulation of the academic credits that constitute the
minimum requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree. Students may also choose to double major, self-design their major, and choose to minor. See the Academic Advising FAQ on "Majors and
Minors." Languge and Cross-Curricular Requirements Technology Information skills are an essential part of a modern liberal arts education. Students should acquire skills in Internet
navigation and research, database searching, and traditional library research. In addition, students should be able to integrate appropriate technology into their learning and research. Elective
Courses In the elective area, students are free to explore fields not otherwise included in the academic program by exploring a diversity of interests, satisfying a curiosity aroused through
General Education or bolstering their major with related study. Whatever the preference, the student should choose electives with a thoughtful awareness of the design of his or her education
