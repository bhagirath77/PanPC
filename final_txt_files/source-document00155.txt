Denver Post owner begs to differ with credit downgrade, Tribune comparison By 12/11/08 6:22 PM Ernest Luning The parent company of the Denver Post disputed a report Thursday afternoon
that followed Moody's Investors Services downgrade of its credit rating to one suggesting a substantial risk of default. An Editor & Publisher article noted that , which filed to reorganize under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday, but the privately held MediaNews Group said the comparison failed to take numerous factors into account and insisted the company wasn't in danger. All
newspaper companies are facing credit downgrades and MediaNews Group is no exception, MediaNews Group, which owns the Denver Post and 53 other daily newspapers, said in a statement
quoted by Editor & Publisher. "MediaNews has always been an industry leader in tightly managing its businesses and liquidity in good times and bad. MediaNews Group is in compliance with all
debt covenants, as has always been the case, and expects to do whatever is needed to stay in compliance during these difficult times. MediaNews Group's debt-to-eaming ratio was almost as
high as that carried by the Tribune Co. An E&P article Thursday afternoon pointed out Moody's calculation that put MediaNews debt at eight times earnings, compared with Tribune Co.'s
leverage of 9-to-1, but a MediaNews spokesman countered that Tribunes nearly $13 billion in debt was owed primarily to banks, while MediaNews owed far less  just under $1 billion  and

made by MediaNews Group CEO Dean Singleton that the sale wasnt a prelude to shutting down the 149-year-old newspaper an announced sale is usually the first step leading to a failing
newspaperdls closure. However appropriate, the Moody's downgrade comes at a tough time for MediaNews as it attempts to remain the last paper standing in Denvers newspaper war.
Analysts have speculated that MediaNews hopes the  which plans to post $18 million in losses this year as the economic downturn has sent advertising revenue plummeting  and would be
