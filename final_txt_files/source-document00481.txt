send private message Currently 5.0/5 Stars. I still have one of their free dial-up accounts from like 2000 or 2001. It still works. Nice to have some kind of backup connection if all else fails (I
got rid of my paid dial-up accounts a few years ago since I use DSL now). A long time ago I used to hear that they charged $49 for calling tech support, but hey, it's free. And there's an easy
fix for that... don't call tech support :) They probably don't do that anymore, though, it may have been an urban myth sort of thing too... who knows. Tags: dial-up, access providers, cheap
