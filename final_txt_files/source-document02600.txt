have an opportunity to learn about the lives, history and culture of California Indians during the fourth annual California Indian Cultural Awareness Conference at Cal State San Bernardino.
One-day field trips are being organized from Sept. 24 to 27 by the San Manuel Tribal Unity and Cultural Awareness Program. A program for the public will feature Southern California bird
singers and northern California brush dancers at 6 p.m. Sept. 27 in the Student Event Center. The program attracted 3,000 last year. Students lear from tribal members and historians about
the history and culture of California's native American tribes. Organizers plan to combat common misconceptions, such as all Indians lived in tepees and beat on drums, by showing students
musical instruments made of gourds and dome-shaped dwellings made of willow branches. "They're going to have a better sense of the California Indian people from this area," said Project
Director James Ramos. "The uniqueness of California is separate from what's been implanted in our minds." Elementary pupils will learn about song, dance, basketry and pottery, listen to
Indian story-telling and taste American Indian foods. Their programs start at 9:30 a.m. and end at 1 p.m. Middle and high school students will participate in panel discussions on California
Indian history, culture and tribal government. They will hear lectures on the mission system, the acquisition of California from Mexico and consequences to native people. Their programs start
at 9 a.m, and end at 1 p.m. Students should bring a sack lunch and schools need to provide chaperones
