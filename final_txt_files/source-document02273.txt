Art is no longer just for walls" Artistic Invisions Eco Active Gallery We are eco active in a variety of ways * We recycle only from allowed beaches; sea glass, shells, bamboo, drift wood and
other allowed items from the ocean. * We follow the guide lines set forth by Puerto Rico's different government agencies with regard to what is allowed to be collected. For instance it has been
discovered that Sea Fans are the only coral that when dies, continues to feed the local marine Eco system, because of this artisans are no longer allowed to use them for art or in artwork. The
Coral Sea Fan is now a protected species. Both vacationers and artists are subject to fines and confiscation of the item, even if in small amounts. * Every collection trip also includes a trash
pick up, in an effort to keep our beaches cleaner. * Our artists donate packaging materials from the parcels they receive year round, keeping our over all cost lower and this planet a little
greener. * We believe in the ship it once concept and it is why we work with the on-line sources that we do, your prints and merchandise, come shipped directly from either the supplier or
manufacturer. Saving the planet from both excessive gas consumption and harmful emissions that come with excessive shipping. * We have freely aided Rincon's Animal Rescue Foundation,
Surf-Rider Foundation, Local School Art Programs and Earth Day just to name a few. * Our future humanitarian efforts will be going to: the Farmer's Market in Rincon and expanding the Art
opportunities for local artists. Images of our community work coming soon
