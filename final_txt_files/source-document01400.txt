Event history Who organises the event? The events are organised and presented by Women in Super - a national network of women working in the superannuation industry. The vast majority
of the people who help to put together the Mothers Day Classic are volunteers. They give their time each year as a way of actively contributing to the fight against breast cancer. This initiative
was inspired by the knowledge that research is gradually improving the survival rate of the one in 8 women who will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their life. Improving the quality of
life of those with breast cancer is a valuable and rewarding investment into our community. Where does the money raised go? All proceeds from the Mothers Day Classic are donated to the , a
not for profit organisation that promotes and supports research into breast cancer prevention and treatment. National Breast Cancer Foundation To date, more than $4.4 million has been
raised for the Foundation in the past eleven years. This money has enabled four major research scholarships to be undertaken. If you would like to make a donation please for more details.
